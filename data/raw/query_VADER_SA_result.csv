That is the only one on your list where i agree, Mithy played alot better post TSM than he did on TSM, but tbf on OG he didnt have to teach his jungler how to play the game while playing support himself.

Lmao excuse me? How did Turtle NOT peak in TSM? You unironically think he has been better on FLY or IMT than he was in  2014 for TSM? You started watching league 2 years ago i guess?

Similiary, Santorin was REALLY good in Spring 2015 and actually helped TSM to an international tournament win. He fell off a cliff in Summer 2015 and stayed that way for quite a while, one can argue that hes better now than he was back then but even here i wouldnt say its obvious by any means.

Bjergsen was bullied BAD. It's well-documented and comes straight from himself: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=676609642362402&id=485525748137460&sfnsn=mo

As for what people praise about him it only takes listening to Parth or Loco talk about him in one of the many long-form interviews/shows to get a sense of how superficially he's the PERFECT player. The perfect teammate. Everything a coach could ask for. Yet every other player TSM places around him always crumbles and can't perform.

This is not unrelated. The fandom or staff's belief that Bjergsen can do no wrong is not random trivia. It contributes to the workplace environment whether intentional or not.

Bjergsen is the consistent performer on TSM. Everyone else underperforms.

Even TSM fans now say something is wrong with TSM as an org instead of putting Bjergsen through more scrutiny.

Now instead of reconsidering their mid position, they offer Bjergsen unprecedented pro player career stability in partial team ownership. People think the Huni contract is overkill? Even Faker would never get Bjergsen's level of special treatment by his org: he had to share the stage with another mid remember?

TSM is gonna get worse before it gets better. This will exacerbate the problem, not solve it. Dardoch thought Loco gave Piglet special treatment on TL... Boy he's in for a ride with TSM now.

Bjergsen is inscrutable within TSM and that didn't happen by accident. If he was really hungry for the win/recognition as a pro player on the world stage he would've voluntarily switched teams or even tried going back to EU to prove himself.

I agree that there is something wrong but you need to grab the right straws.

Zven tried to protect vision around baron, but that wasnt really possible, he also had Trinity instead of Iceborn, which made him really vulnerable.

I don't see a way for TSM to win there. Skarner just runs at someone had he is dead. And yes they could probably have kept TL from taking it for a while, but then TL would have scaled further.

And my point about the DL, Rekkles and Perkz wasn't to prove that he's not better than them, but that FNC and G2 needed a specific style, champ pool and consistency from their bot laners, and DL doesn't match them when it comes to that, hence the weak point (he's better than them at other stuff, but I struggle to think of an EU team that would put that to use).",0.3574,14.899999999999999,72.7,14.899999999999999

Nisqy is a very average mid laner even in NA, same for Blabber as a jungler. Licorice is a good NA top laner but still not very good when you consider the rest of the world, Vulcan is probably their second best player after Zven.

The difference with C9 is they have a really good coach who seems to know how to get his points across and get the team playing basic macro really well for the whole game, something most NA teams can't do.

Since 2017 he is coaching the team Eika played on and this year he is playing again as a support, but I think more due to not having anybody else\^\^.

The bigger issues for TSM though are that the players they get are kinda random. The issue they have are either with Coaching or Bjergsen, because those are the only constants for the team.

Still to this day he has positioning errors just like he did on imt and before then too.

Even if you look at Worlds 2018, you see Zven having much better stats than DL, despite the fact that he played in a much harder group.

TSM only by the end of spring actually started playing fast LoL consistently, before it'd be one fast, one slow game, all because Bjerg couldn't snowball his leads into wins.

Zven also talks how TSM didn't want to renew his contract and has given him a heads up. So that's getting kicked, bro.

And a game like this in a 5 game series, where nothing is happening and your team slowly gets outscaled, it is terrible to play that. Just think about it, if you ever had your promos and you picked an early game champ and won, and you only need to win that game to get to promotion and then your team suddenly decides to do nothing with your lead. That was the position Zven was in. If Zven didn't get caught there the game would likely go on. But Kaisa, Vladimir and Skarner? TSM had no tools to deal with that.

Kobbe was never afraid to go ham if there was an opportunity, but Splyce often stalled in the mid game if they couldn't snowball and 2019 was heavily focused around early game snowball so they were not punished for their slow mid game as often.

TSM seems to be absurdly risk averse, like they only want to play perfect, even if they understand that they need to be willing to take on risk, it just doesn't translate. But Kobbe looks like someone who is willing to go ham, same with Dardoch and Brokenblade.

But this goes beyond any single player or person, it seems to be the expectations around improvement on both an individuel and team level is making them resistent to change.

Just before the C9 game someone from TL said that they don't view C9 as a threat.

I think one of the reasons why C9 is good is because they are really reflected, when they were asked about the other teams they didn't say they are far above anybody else they said that they might lose to DIG because they look really good. And of course some of it is trashtalk, but I honestly think many NA teams are really bad to realize what there position is. When I always hear that TL is far above anybody in NA I wonder why it never shows.

178,positive,"Sneaky will and always will be one of the greatest ADCs NA produced but in recent years I do believe Sneaky has not been performing to the standards or expectations from what is expected of a good ad carry. For example, during 2019 Spring Sneaky had 8.9 CSM and 8.5 during the Summer. In comparison, Zven had 9.5 CSM at Spring with 9.1 CSM at Summer.  (Doublelift had highest CSM at 10.3 during Spring, Cody Sun had highest CSM at 9.5 during Summer)

No offense to Sneaky, but his stats are what I will expect from a player in a low-tier team and even if these stats difference may be small, it will be substantial against top-tier teams.                                                                                                                                                                         If we want to compare CSD@15, Sneaky had an average of -6 CSD@15 while Zven had +2 CSD@15 during Spring. During Summer, Sneaky had an average of -6 CSD@15 while Zven had -7 [CSD@15](mailto:CSD@15).

Shouldn't it be obvious which player should receive higher expectations on their level of performance in pro play? Even in recent times, there are memes about ""Sneaky in lane,"" popularized by Doublelift in 2016 who said Sneaky is trash in lane (but good in teamfights) and to some extent there is some truth in what Doublelift says.

There may be a bit of recency bias here, but I do believe Zven will be a better mechanical player and most consistent than Sneaky, because Zven has always been regarded as a top tier adc (during his G2 and Origen years) by many pros which tells you something about his mechanical prowess while also showing an insane work ethic. In S9, Zven has played around 1806 games in NA solo que ([https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9%20Zven](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9%20Zven)) while Sneaky has played around 1262 games ([https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+Sneaky](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+Sneaky) including his smurf C9 Gun). During S9, Zven has around 1439 games played in S9 while Sneaky has around 1200 games. Also these are just the amount of Solo q games he has played in NA. Zven also has a EUW account ([https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+ZV3N](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+ZV3N)) where he played around 403 games in S8 and around 270 games in S9. Even if C9 does poorly in some games, I don't think it will stop them from being a potentially top 3 team (most likely top 2 as they always had in the past) in NA as they have such a strong showing in the first two weeks with good chemistry and macro play and I believe that Zven will perform consistently well in his future games at C9.

TLDR: Zven has always been a consistent and good mechanical ad carry even with his mishaps at TSM.",0.9865,13.700000000000001,78.5,13.700000000000001
