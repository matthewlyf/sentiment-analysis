2,5e3d836a98b1d71e96cd232b,"I'm really, sincerely grateful to y'all for the award. However, I feel that awards like this are biased toward Rioters like me, because communications is my whole job. Meanwhile, there are so many unrecognized Rioters who add huge amounts of value for players—many of whom just don't feel like they have a reason to talk online to players, even though they do a ton to help Riot and League of Legends succeed. 

**So I have an idea:** What if Riot hosts a Reddit AMA featuring ""The Rioters You've Never Heard Of."" People like Riot's on-campus coffee baristas, copyright lawyers, and digital security experts? We've got some people with really wild jobs. It's not just designers, artists, marketing people, and programmers out here.

My biggest example of this was the league FPS fanart somehow winning best of 2019 and best of the decade when I cant even remember the post itself being very big on here. Compare that to the Lux art which overwhelmingly won best of its year.

I also feel like G2 winning favorite team was due to recency bias. Just feels weird having them be ""best of the decade"" when they have only really been popular for about 2 years with them being half hate/memed on before that...compare that to a team like SKT that has been a constant in the League science's highest level for 7 years and it's definitely recency bias in my opinion.

We can say that those statistics are true for the 3784 respondents, who found tgis survey in one of league reddit subs and answered to it.

I don't know if it's possible to do this like it should be done - to be able to generalize results to whole lol subreddit community.

268,5e3d841e98b1d71e96cd2755,"The Bot Lane reason for playing; 'I enjoy being the carry' really emphasises the single most problematic element of LoL game design. 

Bot laner is meant to be a role in the game, but somehow it's become the game. Juggernaughts and bruisers counter tanks. For some reason, ADC does too. Melee DPM are good at taking neutral objectives. ADCs can do it almost as fast and more safely. Split pushers are good at taking towers, but ADCs are the only ones able to crack a defended tower. Teamfight champs are good at teamfighting at the expense of other elements. ADCs are good at teamfighting while also being good at almost all other elements.

ADCs are just an incredibly broken role that needs reworking so other role players can be able to play their role, and the idea that 'I play bot  because I enjoy being the carry' is fundamentally problematic because every role, except maybe support, should be able to impactfully carry a game and most of the time, they can't because ADC is too good at too much. Just make ADC champs the tower and neutral objective taking necessity that they already are (you basically can't win the game without your ADC alive unless you're fed enough to dive) at the expense of their PvP damage please, Riot. We already have whole classes designed to be ' 'tank/squishy' busters' who are just standing in the shadow of champions like Lucian and Senna who are for some reason Dashy/CC loaded poke DPM assassins.

With Supports like Nautilus, Leona, Thresh, Pyke and other Tanky playmaking supports being the strongest/most popular in their role instead of more ""boring"" champs like Lulu or Janna, more people tend to switch their role or atleast their secondary role to support.

I for example switched from jungle/top to jungle/sup and occasionally also que sup/jungle. Same for some friends of mine.

I've also seen people, and also saw it myself, that get autofilled to top or midlane, but not support. Not so long ago people were complaining that they get autofilled to support too often.",League of Legends Survey Results,2020-02-07 08:23:35
541,5e3d842f98b1d71e96cd2b99,"As far as I can tell, all web forums and matchmaking services outside the game itself skew heavily towards supports.  Even during the height of the support drought in dynamic queue this seemed to be the case.

For those that don't remember, Dynamic Queue was Summoner's Rift, but with auto-fill turned off and people could queue up as exactly the champion they wanted in the position they wanted as long as they were willing to wait to find the remaining players willing to play with them.  If you wound up on a team with something you didn't agree with, (like Soraka jungle or an Eve player or something) you could instantly re-queue with no penalty and you'd only get a lower priority if you did it a few times.

During that time if you queued as a mid you might wait five minutes to find your first teammate, because too many people were trying to get mid compared to the other roles.  If however you queued for support you could literally be placed on a team of five players ready to go within 7 seconds.  And you could be rude to these people and tell them to change their champions because you knew that you could find 3 more teams inside 30 seconds and any one of them might agree to your demands.  ...but I digress...

Even during that time, when it was obvious to everyone that support was the least popular role in general, team building sites like LoLDuo (rip) and Discord lobbies of that type had a disproportionately high percentage of free agent supports looking for people to play with.

My hypothesis is that this skewing is partially accounted for by the role thematically attracting players who are more social to begin with and partially by the role pragmatically requiring team play.  When your whole shtick is starting the game as very powerful champions and investing that power into your teammates until your champions are very weak by themselves you kind of want to find teammates you believe are worth the investment.  Other roles, who build up their own personal power over the course of the game, are probably more content with the built-in matchmaking.",League of Legends Survey Results,2020-02-07 09:51:39

I can only speak for myself but I'd be in favour of bans if presented the choice. I'd probably point to the reasons presented why people play aram and pick out that 'it is relaxing' and the enjoyment of constant team fighting. 

After the amount of games I've played in the mode I'm bored of seeing heavily weighted teams of a specific type of champion and being able to pinch that pool (e.g. poke champions) a bit is something I'd welcome. 

Since the nature of the mode is random, sometimes you aren't given the tools to deal with a heavily weighted comp of one type of champion and bans kind of give you something in that regard.

Veigar is another one. You can also feel that his numbers have been toned down, but it's still pretty annoying that his cage blocks half the lane and then he gets to point and click, blow you up.

Senna is the new one that I absolutely hate playing against. If you don't have the right champions to just dive on her or poke back at her, like Xerath, she just stands a mile away and pokes you down while simultaneously healing herself + team.

The people who play LoL AND browse Reddit might not be representative for all the people who play LoL because it arguable takes a certain amount of dedication for a videogame to spend time on related subreddits. Which is probably one of the reasons why the elo graph here shows much more Plat and Diamond players. I'm sure there are people who lied about their elo, but the average elo on Reddit is probably higher than the average elo of the entire playerbase in the first place, because a Diamond player is probably more likely to spend time here than a Bronze player. Especially on the champion main specific subreddits where this survey was also posted I believe.

Most people not familiar with statistics overestimate how large of a sample size you need by **a lot.** For an example, Gallup polls, which are used to draw (usually pretty accurate) conclusions about the entire population of the US (320m+ people), only use a sample size of 1000 or 1500. 

The only noteworthy things regarding the sample is that this survey should only be used to make conclusions about the average LoL player *who uses Reddit* and *is willing to fill out a survey.* These traits will skew the data obviously, so it can't be taken to be representative of the entire playerbase overall. For example, it heavily overrepresents English-speaking players, since it was posted on Reddit and the survey was, presumably, only available in English. It also likely skews skill-level upwards, since if you're involved enough in LoL to read a subreddit about it, you're probably better than the average player. You could even get interesting effects like support players being over-represented because support is a role naturally about helping others, so they're more likely to spend the time to take a survey and help someone gather data.",League of Legends Survey Results,2020-02-07 06:58:24

774,5e3d843e98b1d71e96cd2f3d,"I have a little theory actually. There's evidence to back up that men and women's brains evolved differently, specifically when processing information. Men were hunters, so they're better at tracking movement, and responding quickly to threats. Women were gatherers, so they're better at spotting tiny details, and noticing things out of the ordinary, as well as juggling household tasks ergo multitasking.

Carry role's need to be able to follow a teamfight, they need instant reactions to zhonya's that Varus R, or perfect awareness of where an opponent is moving too, making them more ideal for the traditional hunter's fundamental skillset.

Supports need to juggle active items and extra buttons, they need to notice ""We don't have vision on Baron anymore, we need to check it."" or ""There's a loose honeyfruit, someone's been here recently.""

838,5e3d844298b1d71e96cd303d,"I've got 6k and I can tell you Fiddle and Syndra are NBD. Fiddle falls off pretty hard late game; you just have to hold ground and not feed early. Syndra's pushback + stun is annoying, but it's pretty narrow so someone will be able to get her. Plus, because she has to use two abilities to get the stun, you should have enough time after snowballing her to land a CC of your own.

Personally, I don't think there are any champions that are so overwhelmingly strong on the map that they *need* bans, but I would like bans anyway. If I had to list champs that I thought are closest to ""needing"" bans, I would go with Veigar, Sion, and Yi. Veigar for the massive stun zone and ezpz delete button R. Sion because his passive can cheese towers/inhibs. Yi if people figure out how to do him correctly; I learned from seeing someone do it years ago, but no one seems to catch on. AD/crit yi will look more dominant, but Titanic Tank Yi is a much more consistent winner. It's the only champ I've ever been able to claw back a 1v9 with, and I've done it two or three times. The biggest weakness of that build is its utter uselessness until 6, during which time your team may decide to initiate and die in bad fights while you can do nothing about it.

Now, what I would actually use bans for.... (Edit: Sett right now because he's overtuned/hasn't had his map changes put in yet). Veigar sure because he's annoying af, but someone else will probably hit that so I'll go with Vayne or Aurelion Sol tertiary. Aurelion Sol is easy; I haven't seen one do well on the map since like release month. When someone's basically dead weight, the game is going to be less fun, regardless of which side that weight is on. Similar for Vayne, but not always. Vayne both requires drastically different play on ARAM and is very matchup dependent. She'll usually have a hard time because her range is so bad, and most people simply fail to adapt and wind up free-feeding with her, but even at best she won't do amazingly against typical comps. Where she shines is against melee/tank heavy comps, which she will steamroll with her W late game, and she cannot be shut down early due to the constant inflow of exp/gold in ARAM.

They all ended up being support mains very quickly so we had to take our turns supporting when we played together. 

The 2nd role they fought for the most was adc obviously so I didn't even care about that role too much. 

Once we started playing ranked we got very different ranks and we wanted to climb so didn't play much together anymore.

It was still the old draft where I could get any role and I was so fuckin bad at adc because I never played it that I ended up asking for the role every single game until I could learn to not feed my ass off all the time at least. 

It was very challenging and I put so much effort into learning the role that it became a passion and I'm an ad main ever since. 

My friends are still supports. :D

I remember when yummi released and I tried to lane with her. If my adc went afk for 3 to 4 min or didn't know how to play with yummi as a sup, the game was most likely a loss. 

But that doesn't happen in every game. On ranked games you and your adc are probably at the same level of skills. And if that's not the case, you can always focus on your teammates and do well by assisting them with ganks or by warding some key spots. I don't play normal SR so I don't know about that and on other modes it's easier cause you can chose on whom to put your focus.

The role as a whole has a lot of agency with few drawbacks. You can do lots of things (initiate fights, gank, heal etc) but you cannot be the carry. There are exceptions but I don't consider them as true supports, they are the second APC of the team.

Also, winning the lane =/= doing well in lane. You don't have to dominate your opponents. That's not a healthy mentality to have if you want to ""progress"" in the game.

I find that very hard to believe. First of all, Gold 4 0LP at the end of the season is already below the 50th percentile which means the median LoL player is already _at least_ Gold.

Secondly, commitment may not be enough to make a player good but it surely is one of the requirements. You definitely can't be good at something without actually trying even a little bit. Lower rank players (especially Iron/Bronze) tend to be people who really don't think much about League and just play as a very casual pastime.

1255,5e3d845c98b1d71e96cd36c1,"I agree the alpha thing was a little overboard. 

Anyways, 52% of women are in a relationship, 64% of them play with their partner. I feel this is because their partner also plays league.  Where as for the men in a relationship, i feel most of their girlfriends DONT play league.  That is why those numbers are skewed there.

But this leaves us with 48% of all female reddit league players. These women don't play with their partner, but i bet the majority are support players. Its easier to just toss the girls into the roll with the least importance.  Like you said,  its not that big a deal if they get caught. 

I like that you would recommend support to any new player though, not just girls. Anecdotally, new guy players get a more in depth explanation on different characters and how cool they are, but the new girls are just tossed in a role where they can 'learn but also not be in the way'. 

Personally, i dont think support is a good way to learn the game. When everyone is new, no one knows how to cs or do any of the other nonsense. Let them play in their elo. Playing just support from the beginning actually hinders on those skills from being learned.

The stats seem clear. A lot more women started the game because their partner plays it. Further, women profess to playing with their partner often. 

The more likely answer is that someone really dedicated to League gets their girlfriend to play with them and they like it. They give them the easiest champ/role which is support/enchanter. They feel like they are contributing to the win while the more experienced player,  usually the boyfriend, carries.

1332,5e3d846198b1d71e96cd37f5,"There are two definitions of ""gender"". One is what you're using, which is just a synonym for ""sex"". 

The other definition refers to **performative** aspects of being a man or woman that can change depending on the time or place. For example, wearing a skirt is considered feminine and something that women do, but that is performative. It's not biology. It's not a scientific factor in determining one's sex, like having XY or XX chromosomes. And there are cultures where men wear skirts and it isn't considered feminine at all. This is the definition of gender most people are using when talking about being trans or non-binary. 

Being non-binary I believe just means you don't neatly fit into what society considers male or what society considers female.

Like normal people, stupid? The vast majority of people don't act as caricatures of their gender, they just exist, without having to define everything as masculine/feminine and worrying about how others perceive them like that. I have tomboy friends who aren't ashamed to like feminine things without calling themselves a trans polysexual gay enby.

Can you tell me how to write my comments in a womanly way too? How about the womanly way of taking the train? Can you tell me that?

Morgana was roaming without vision and, unfortunately, got caught while trying to put a ward. Gragas was away from the carries, and everyone keeps testing their luck vs the fed Kat. 

I'm not taking credit away from OP; the discipline it takes to net every kill without over-extending and getting to eager is respectable. On the same line, the play around Kennen's stun was also really good. 

A true mixture of split enemies vs a fed assassin, a succession of dumb events followed by disciplined and controlled actions that resulted in a penta. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽",The rare no-assists pentakill!,2020-02-07 12:12:11

I suggest you do try playing that 'garbage', so you can learn what it does and subsequently how to play against it. Her E cooldown is reduced by a % every time she jumps on a dagger, this scales up with level. Early game her E is on a 3s cooldown *after picking up a dagger*.

>When she jumps she just needs to ult for 2 sec and then get jump again and that usually kills at least 1 person if not more and that gets you another reset and you can do it all over again million times.

If she ults for 2 seconds, she should die. She cannot move while ulting, it's easy to hit an immobile target with abilities. Her standard combo is E-W-Q-Gunblade-R-E, this is only enough to kill a squishy target if Kat is ahead, as the one in the clip is.

>Even if they stun you it will probably be when you already jumped so you already did W dmg and ult dmg in the same time (for some reason) and they got from 100-20% hp in 1 sec.
...no? W dagger takes 1.25s to land after casting, Ult takes 2.5s to deal it's full damage - you mainly only use this to apply grievous wounds and keep damage up while waiting for daggers to land. In the clip they only melt so fast because *kat is fed* and they do not itemise against it - they are punished for poor play, as they should be.

>Not to mention that she has always been ap assasin but now she just needs to chill and buy lifesteal and shes suddenly strongest 1v1 mid laner in the game.

This is just objectively wrong. Kat buys gunblade, which is *omnisteal*, not lifesteal. She is not the strongest 1v1 mid laner in the game by quite some margin, in fact she is actually *weak* in 1v1 scenarios, her strength is cleaning up teamfights with resets.

>She was always not that hard to play but at least you could have countered her effective and it was fun in the game.
Old Kat was pretty facerolly, but new Kat is actually *exceptionally difficult* to play from a micro perspective. You need to have good decision making, quick mechanics, you need to be able to predict your opponents and accurately judge your damage to get resets. If you do not get resets, you are useless. I don't understand what you mean by ""countered her effective and it was fun"", new Katarina has a much larger window for counterplay. For example, her E has a 0.15s cast time and 0.85s command buffering delay, her W takes 1.25s to land, she needs to wait for Q dagger to land after casting, the aforementioned 3s cd on E early *with dagger* (14s without). The champion is fine.

>This is just pure trash and people only play her when they are stuck so they can hopefully win by cheeseing others

I'm sorry but this is just salt talking. You cannot realistically complain about a champion if you do not take the time to understand their strengths and weaknesses. When I see Kat get locked in I enjoy the free lane.",The rare no-assists pentakill!,2020-02-07 11:42:14

1763,5e3d848798b1d71e96cd3eb5,"Basically you're sending a ton of experience and gold your enemy's way. At that point you're not in a position where you can capitalize on an inhibitor. Mid is the worst inhibitor to take because it doesn't force people away from the epic monsters (generally botlane inhib is the most valuable simply because it physically puts defenders the furthest away from Baron). If you take that mid inhibitor your wave is going to permanently push into the enemy and the enemy won't really lose access to contest for objectives. 

Even if the wave crashed on the nexus turrets, mid inhib is the only inhibitor where all creeps can be targeted by both turrets simultaneously, meaning it's the one that deals less damage to turrets overall. Creeps also don't funnel into one turret, so the damage is spread across the two, further diminishing potential damage that is going to be regened anyway. Your team will have a hard time farming the creeps that meet your super waves, not only because they'll be further in and riskier because of it, but because supers make damage calculations for lasthitting very hard. The buffed siege minions twoshot creeps, and it also buffs the casters' attack. 

The creeps themselves aren't that hard to clear for the enemy team because their HP scale with game time. A 35 min super is infinitely tankier than a 20 minute one. Basically, you're just permafreezing a lane on their side of the map when you don't really have anything to do objective wise to make it a decent tradeoff.","T1 do the correct play, LS loses his mind",2020-02-07 12:23:58

Not without giving up way too much. You can just have, say, your ADC hold down the mid lane, while the rest of your team defends the outers. At this point in the game, towers are really powerful still and a 1-man advantage won't guarantee you a good fight like it does later on in the game.

If you rotate bot-to-mid-to top you can create 5v3 situations top-lane as long as you have pressure while taking up enemy jungle.

Ryze Mid farming it up and getting huge with R ready to respond on any inner turrets plays.

Vayne in a single lane (say bot) ready to push or 1v1 if you leave her alone there, farming it up.

Top and Jgl defending top turret and scouting jungle for any collapse.

Mobo boots support hovering between top and bot and rotating faster than you would (because of mobos) to support either lane, with a focus on warding / scouting bot jungle (to support my Vayne).

The amount of damage Ornn can bring to the table as a tank is just way too much for the amount of CC, tankiness, and RANGE his abilities have. Don't even get me started on the soraka insanity this game as well. In every fight, you can see the moment anyone attempts to get on her, her passive just turbo-boosts her somewhere safe or she gets a singular heal and she's back to full.

I don't think it would work tbh, Olaf is already insanely fast when it comes to jungle camps and neutral objectives because he can build AD while mantaining dps from Q, W and E. Building BRazor would just make his Q and E hurt for much less.

That and BRazor is kinda ass compared to Warrior. The only jungle champs that build it are Yi and Twitch (not exactly suited for competitive) and they do that to scale better.

2389,5e3d84c698b1d71e96cd487e,">Hle dmg wasnt a problem.

That's my point, it should have been a problem.

Olaf didn't build damage and yet with utility items like Righteous Glory he was running down the damage dealers of HLE.

You can argue that he was alive for 3 times longer than he would be if he didn't have a Soraka Yuumi, which is fair. But by default, if people who build tank actually tanked instead of dealing damage you wouldn't run into these problems to begin with rather than nerfing Soraka + Yuumi and waiting for the next enchanter to heal Olaf into going 1v5.

Not saying Olaf is the only example of the issue but he's one of the main champions who can abuse it for sure.",Hanwha Life Esports vs. T1 / LCK 2020 Spring - Week 1 / Post-Match Discussion,2020-02-07 11:37:50
2390,5e3d84c698b1d71e96cd4882,"One, I'm not in favor of Yuumi.

However you're giving your personal opinion and masking it as a fact. Yuumi, like many champions before her (including but not limited to Akali) can be balanced. Yuumi's design is unique and there's plenty of people who will enjoy her for whatever reason, and that's enough to give her a place in League imo. We need more unique champions to appeal to all the fucked up fellas out there.

That said, Yuumi isn't the problem. The problem is champions like Olaf who are capable of building tank and utility (not even full tank) and just run down carries with auto attacks and targeted true damage.

Yuumi and Soraka as enchanters simply play on the fact that if you keep Olaf alive for a bit he's going to 1v4. Try doing the same with Ornn, Sion or any other tank and see if they can go 1v3 or 1v4 and win. This is a problem with certain champions having too much damage while building utility (not even straight tank, as Righteous Glory is more utility than tank).

Olaf isn't the only offender but as the one who can build SV and tank and deals damage mostly through auto attacks and targeted true damage hits, he's definitely one of the main beneficiaries of enchanters being out there.",Hanwha Life Esports vs. T1 / LCK 2020 Spring - Week 1 / Post-Match Discussion,2020-02-07 11:41:34

>Also, Teddy did not have executioner's until after he finished his BT. Which was his 3rd completed item.

Traditionally assassins e.g. Zed, Talon, Rengo, Kha would be the solution, but since supports can miss their peel, but still out heal and shield any burst damage, champs are no longer going to die from all ins.

However I do think shield stacking needs to be nerfed, you can all in a champ as Zed, Talon etc and hit them with everything, yet they just use their own shield plus seraphs and tank everything, and trying to all in them when CDs are down is pretty much useless now due to all the free CDR supports get.",Hanwha Life Esports vs. T1 / LCK 2020 Spring - Week 1 / Post-Match Discussion,2020-02-07 12:02:45

So before answering maybe check your facts because 40% CDR zed can ult you twice after burning your zhonya before it comes back up (if done on CD so ofc not in an actual game but he can do it once).

All 100% agreed with. I have always wondered about the instrument and I think it should be expanded upon, not left to be a total mystery that has to be filled in by the players. That was very much the case with Old League lore, but nowadays the Universe is so immensely detailed and jam-packed with information about the various Champions, Runeterra, other characters and places beyond, that it seems silly to have her background information amount to a few mysterious paragraphs of text.","Valeeva, darkin sister of Varus, is trapped in Sona's etwahl.",2020-02-07 14:34:41

>There is literally no lore whatsoever surrounding this as a possibility, Sona has no signs of being affected by Darkin blood magic (and no, she did not do what Shadow Assassin Kayn did to Rhaast), and the etwahl is an Ionian instrument. Why would a Shuriman Ascendent have an Ionian instrument as a weapon to be sealed in by the Aspect of Twilight? Ionia is on a whole different continent and the ancient Shuriman empire was not known to travel the seas and conqueror on other continents.

>To expand further on the Darkin blood magic part, a physically weak host will be destroyed by their magic. An ideal host has a strong body, or the Darkin uses multiple bodies (in Aatrox's case, hundreds) to sustain themselves if the body isn't capable of withstanding the form they force upon it. Kayn is a student of Zed and is very strong physically, and Varus had to fuse two people for a suitable host, although this backfired as he has issues snuffing out their conscious. Tryndamere would be a dream host for Aatrox, as would the likes of Olaf or Illaoi, but he uses whatever comes by for the sake of escaping the darkness of being trapped within his sword. Sona isn't anything like the aforementioned people, she would be grounded meat from the power of blood magic being forced on her.

>Also, Darkin cannot move inside their weapons, and they tend to control whoever seizes them immediately and not wait for a suitable host, so no one can move etwahl about without becoming host, assuming it is a Darkin (it isn't).

The other person kinda declared the etwahl being a Darkin as fact, while you say its just a conspiracy, but just throwing that out to explain the tone of the quote. Sona lore is bad, as are a good chunk of orher champs, so fair enough you have nothing to work with and are just having fun.

i don't think ionia is really a place of interest for darkin at all

valmar(?) and kai(?), the two dudes controlled by varus are ionian, yes, but varus himself(itself?) isn't. all darkin iirc are shuriman by nature, seeing as how they're corrupted forms of shuriman ascended (not baccai/failed ascended as in xerath but think nasus or renekton with serious ptsd after the war with the void in icathia.) varus himself(itself?) was locked away in a bow and taken as a personal weapon by an ancient ionian queen.

as for kayn, he, too, is not ionian. he was a noxian child soldier taken in by zed during the noxian invasion of ionia. even rhaast isn't ionian. i did mention that the darkin originated in shurima, but even ignoring that, rhaast was uncovered in an ancient noxian ruin, and stolen by kayn so that it wouldn't get to be used by the noxians against ionia

so all in all, of the three darkin that we know of so far, one has recently been tormenting the people of the freljord and fighting targonian pseudo-ascended (aatrox), one was uncovered in noxus and taken by a noxian defector to ionia (rhaast), and only one was actually locked away in ionia (varus), which makes the ionian connection dubious at best.

as for the rest, i haven't read any of sona's lore so i couldn't attest to any of it, but tbh i'm kinda hoping sona's etwahl doesn't turn out to be the next darkin. riot has mentioned that this season they want to focus less on creating new characters and more on bringing lore characters to life (a la senna) and i'd rather the sister be a full fledged champ than a rehashed sona or skin.","Valeeva, darkin sister of Varus, is trapped in Sona's etwahl.",2020-02-07 15:15:19

Just because you have a high winrate doesn't mean it's a dedicated player base. It could be the champ is just overtuned.

And just because you have a low pick rate also doesn't mean it's a dedicated player base. Some champs are simply not popular at all and have breath or depth of players.

In fact, a couple of years ago this was confirmed to be true by [this riot post](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/11/champ-popularity-mixing-math-art/). **In here you can clearly see A-sol does NOT have a player base that has lots of games on him.

2637,5e3d84db98b1d71e96cd4c60,"One thing I would say is that I think the star mechanic is actually not really why Aurelion Sol isn't played. I think it's the fact that one of his basic abilities is a long cooldown roaming tool. Many people just can't take advantage of having such a low cooldown roam without losing lane too badly. And if you get behind in lane, it becomes super costly to roam constantly.

But the thing is, he has to be balanced around having such a strong roaming tool. Which means that if you don't use it, the champ ends up feeling kind of weak and underwhelming. 

Personally, I like DPS mages with interesting mechanics, so potentially Aurelion Sol could be right up my alley, but I'm just not good enough at managing mid lane and having the proper map awareness to pull off the constant roams, let alone successful roams.

On the other hand, I have played him, and I don't find the star mechanic is really that hard to manage once you get used to it. I've played him on Howling Abyss. I believe he is buffed on that map, because he doesn't have to be balanced around roaming all the time. You mostly use his E for getting back to lane and chasing, the two easiest and most straightforward things to use it for. And on that map he is fairly easy to play and fun.

So this rework actually didn't do anything really. They just shifted some things around. What they should've done is switch his E and R. That way, his roam would be on a longer cooldown, so he wouldn't have to be balanced around roaming constantly. Furthermore, it would be a lot easier to use, since it would be a very clear and obvious opportunity for a playmaking tool when you have it up, like a Twisted Fate ult.

And also having Aurelion Sol's R tuned down on put on a short cooldown I think would make him a bit easier too, since it would give him a consistent way to keep enemies at star range.

Not that I don't think this wouldn't alienate some of his playerbase. I know a lot of them love the early roaming playstyle. But if they wanted to make him more accessible, I think that would be the way to go.",Aurelion Sol's rework in 9.17 utterly failed to deliver on stated goals,2020-02-07 14:49:56

Most of the hate I see is for new W; while I agree it changes the feel of the champ, people do not seem to appreciate how versatile an on demand movespeed boost makes Asol in fights. 

The E as well, different feel but also different power budget. Have you ever sat mid and just looked at the range indicator of his E? What about from fountain to midlane? It’s almost TF ult range, and is unbelievably powerful at all stages of the game. The passive movespeed loss sucks for fishing for roams, but the compensation was definitely there.

Lastly all the QoL buffs he got on Q helped a lot. You used to just be fucked if you didn’t have ult and an assassin jumped you, but with early cancel q and the w movespeed boost you actually have a chance now. The little speed boost you get moving towards your q in motion also makes those more consistent. Conqueror helped a lot too, but a lot people who play Asol are divided on that.

my point is just that things really weren't that bad as riot made it seem, the champ was just not for everyone and that was fine, he was useless untill you learned how to win and then your winrate would skyrocket

He also got absolutely clowned on at worlds, especially in the FPX series where he got a 4-buff start against Tian but then STILL failed to do absolutely anything as Tian snowballed the game for FPX and landed gank after gank left and right while Broxah was always late to the play.

It's absolutely possible it was a result of the internal struggles Fnatic had but calling him ""world class"" after such a weak worlds showing is probably not the best of ideas.

They are a massive risk. They are less likely to stick with their teams, are more likely to have visa issues, and basically always get worse when coming to NA. Remember -- Crown was supposed to be a top player as well and he has been abysmal in NA.

>Just saw your comment history and I see that you're just a NA Native player die hard.

How is this relevant? The reason I'm pro native talent is because the facts overwhelmingly point to developing native talent as being better for the competitiveness of the region. I don't understand how the fact that I have extensively researched this issue somehow makes my points less valid -- if anything it makes them more valid.

>Like we fail internationally every year because our players can't keep up with the competition.

You know why our players can't keep up? Because the import bias in NA means they hardly get chances.

3304,5e3d855198b1d71e96cd56cd,"The win still matters the same, it’s just the idea of them getting that win against a wounded team. Of course they’ll take the win but nothing is better than beating your opponent at full strength so there are no excuses. Look at Houston winning the championship the year Jordan played baseball, then them never winning again when Jordan came back. People put an asterisk next to Houston’s win because they knew the Bulls weren’t at their full strength and couldn’t even make it to the finals. I guess it’s just a mentality thing but I wouldn’t feel fully deserving of a win if my opponent isn’t at their full strength.

As far as the removal of sightstone and tracker’s knife, I wouldn’t consider them to be in the same context as TL not having Broxah. Literally missing a starting player is much different than the meta changing to something your region isn’t that good at. The meta constantly changes and has pretty much changes every year at Worlds and Korea still dominated. People tried to copy Korea in the past and did a subpar job at it, so instead other regions played to their own strengths and it worked much better for them.

impact - at best a good weak side top laner (below gimgoon naturally) and way worse in a somewhat top focused meta compared to wunder, kiin or heck even TheShy
Hell licorice who is around bwipo level or worse 

Broxah - at best easily a top world class jungler and the best on the team (last time we saw that was worlds 2018 tho) with his recent decline i would rank him from a bit below xmithies average to a bit above last split mvp svenskeren) 
He is definetly not on jankos level, has potentially trouble to contest xerxe (who looks clean) and may be contested by blaber

jensen - eh... bad worlds, meh msi. no top 3 western mid. might possibly not even top 3 in NA if froggen, nisqy and po€ or bjerg show up.

DL - great domestically and outside of his weak international performance is most likely a top 3 or top 5 adc in the west (rekkles, perkz(now caps? who is unclear) upset. Til now kobbe and now zven all look or looked better or even)
the best card for an na team tho (no import and at worst a domestic star)

Corejj - great support, most likely top 3 in the west


The team definetly still has weaknesses just by player lvl


if you only compare to na tho~ 

c9 is pretty much the only comparable team there

Okay. I asked because there were a lot of rumours surrounding Fnatic that they were split in 3 (it wasn't just Rekkles having an issue with the team), so I thought you actually had something to contribute to this. At one point, even Rekkles was rumoured to be leaving. 2018 Broxah might have been good but he was under a lot of criticism in 2019, so I am sure this had something to do with what /u/Oldwarblues is saying.

C9 on the other hand discarded the aggressive Svenskeren with the psychotic Blaberfish who is way more aggressive and they completely revamped their botlane (which was, even tho some people claim different things, their biggest weakness).

Both Teams have high skill players and ultimately both can either fail or bring glory to NA. Multiple Superteams managed to mess up while some teams with rather unknown players before entered the scene with a boom.

The only reason you would bring past results up is for mental warfare (example C9 choking vs post-franchise TL so they are more nervous) and because there are toxic fans everywhere who try to justify their team being superior no matter what.

C9 had no LCS title in ages argument? You get hit with the ""but we made it out of groups/into semifinals"".

Consequently, Anivia is, for the most part, safe from ganks and is in control of the lane.

Now, I’ve seen some comments say it doesn’t matter, Kata would’ve just shoved the wave and forced a reset etc. Sure, but Anivia is a ranged champ and has prio on a wave on her side of the lane. She can freely harass Kata if she tries to get closer to clear the wave, and moreover Lee is around mid side so any abilities expended to try to clear the wave will put Kata herself in danger. This is precisely why jungle presence is important in the game. Lee does not need to do anything besides show himself and any regular player would know that a gank might be coming and back off from the wave (unless of course you’re extremely fed and you’re confident that you’re able to 1v2 your opposing solo laner and their jg).

4082,5e3d860098b1d71e96cd62f9,"Don’t apologize! It’s a weird concept for a beginner. If you look at the two minion waves, Kat has more creeps than Anivia and they are in a position close to Anivia’s tower. This is bad for Katarina as they are not fully pushed in, so if she wants to walk up and last hit or to harass Anivia, she risks being ganked, and cannot fully commit to a trade without taking tower damage or being stunned under tower. This is terrible for Kat. Anivia knows this, and is keeping a couple of Kat’s creeps alive every wave so that she can control where the wave sits in the lane. Katarina cannot break the freeze (by fully pushing into tower to bounce the wave back, another concept you may want to look into via YouTube) without her jungler coming to the lane and threatening a 2v1 versus Anivia to push the lane into tower. This forces Katarina to give up CS, or take bad trades and risk being ganked. Lee Sin fails the gank, then not only takes farm from Anivia setting her behind, but pushes the lane and ends the freeze that Anivia set up. Thus, making the lane worse for Anivia as Kat is now free to trade without threat, and exposes her to potential jungler ganks from the blue side.

Usually done by either maintaining the enemy wave with 2/3 more minions than yours depending on how close to the tower you want it to be or simply tanking it until your minion wave arrives.

By doing this you can force the enemy laner to use spells to push the wave into your tower, prevent all ins since you are the one under tower, setup all ins/ganks since the enemy has to run back to his tower or just simply deny the enemy gold and exp by zoning.

Not only that Lee Sin TAKES THE GOLD and leeches experience and gives Katarina that full wave, letting Katarina back in the game in a hard matchup, giving her free road to level 6 to roam. Anivia doesn't even get tear so she doesn't start being a champion yet.

EDIT: also Katarina after this could keep the lane neutral or even slightly shoving into her meaning Anivia is vulnerable to Ekko and IMO Ekko Katarina > Lee Anivia until Lee gets hexdrinker",Freezing in plat,2020-02-06 17:17:13

If the enemy has 3 or more minions than you, the wave will keep pushing towards you, so basically you just shave off the wave until they have 3 minions more than you to set up a freeze.

---

Freezes are useful for a variety of reasons. Freezing is probably one of the best ways to gain an advantage 1v1.

First of all, this prevents champions from all-ining you because you're so close to the tower. In this example, Katarina does win all-ins against Anivia if Anivia misses Q. However, since Anivia is so close to her tower, Katarina can't chase her down to kill her. On the flipside, if Katarina ever makes a mistake, Anivia can chase Katarina down if she needs to since Katarina is so far from her tower.

This second part isn't really that useful for a matchup like Anivia vs Katarina. However, if you're playing Darius and you're freezing against a Nasus, the fact that they're so far from the tower means that as Darius, if Nasus walks up to CS, you just E him and then chase him down, basically guaranteeing that he dies. This means that Nasus has to give up nearly EVERY SINGLE CS, giving Darius a HUGE gold lead.

Second of all, freezing makes it almost impossible to gank you because you're so close to the tower.

Finally, freezing makes the enemy laner super open to ganks because they have to walk so far up to CS.

---

#TL;DR

In this scenario, Anivia can bully out Katarina with AA, Q, and E everytime Katarina goes to CS, and Katarina can't do anything against it because Anivia is so close to tower and Katarina doesn't win trades unless she jumps onto Anivia.

This means that Katarina has to give up CS, otherwise she tanks an autoattack for each one, giving Anivia a huge lead.

What Lee Sin does here is he starts pushing the wave, meaning Anivia can no longer freeze.",Freezing in plat,2020-02-06 21:09:19

4339,5e3d861098b1d71e96cd66fd,"No because depending on a ton of variables, it can mean a few things.

- you forfeit ""priority"", which is your ability to react to someone needing help elsewhere. If your jungler needs help, you're either stuck there with the freeze or you miss exp by going to help.
""Shoving"" (which is just hitting the creeps as much as possible while still last hitting) allows you to keep said priority.

- speaking of shoving, some champs just always want you under your tower. Blitz finds it a lot easier to hook you when there's no creeps to hide behind. It also taxes the enemies ability to last hit under tower, which may cause them to miss a few, or maybe even coordinate a dive gank.

Freezing alone doesn't help you win lane, doesnt apply pressure and can completely back fire but in the right situations, it allows you to put your opponent in an awkward spot if it's not addressed.

Once you start understanding the scenarios of when to shove, freeze and being mindful of where the wave is in a given lane, this is the foundation of ""Wave manipulation"" which is very hard to master but allows you to maximize your gold and exp income.",Freezing in plat,2020-02-07 09:42:36

Again, here is the lane before Lee touches a single minion

Kat has 4 extra minions. If she's really fucking safe player she can q, dagger proc the melees, and then e out and reset.

Keep in mind Anivia has no realistic way to 

1. Zone Kat off the wave. She can Q.... but Kat just e's it. She can E... but that's negative damage without Q amp. She can Auto... but then she'll probably take more damage in minions and risks getting all in'd if she walks into auto wave.

2. She can't thin the wave. If she q's minions, which doesn't even do much, Kat will just immediately combo the wave and reset it with zero recourse.

3. She can't burst Kat if Kat chooses to full combo the wave. Q+ E + 3 autos will NOT get Kat anywhere near kill range, and Anivia doesn't even have ignite + elecrocute to make such a play feasible.",Freezing in plat,2020-02-06 17:47:29

After doing that you gave the lv 4 kata 2 waves for free which you could have forced her to play up towards anivia's tower (which is good cuz lee sin is on your team makes kata easily killable). but you also delay anivia 6 which makes kata roams even better because anivia can't stop this champion.

At lvl 6, and if Kat hasn't fucked up wave, Anivia has no way to step up beyond the halfway point of lane and she'll be further behind

Idk what elo you're playing in, but this is clearly a high plat low dia game and this shit is very obvious lol

I've had players leave losing games because another player decided to grief them, I never complained because I know how it feels

You're asking why Anivia's time is more valuable, but why is Lee's time more valuable than Anivia's? Why is Lee allowed to grief another player just because he felt like it despite him being in the wrong? 

Either way, everyone's time is wasted this game because now you have an Anivia that can't control her wave anymore because she's a wave and a half worth of XP behind her opponent if Kat plays it appropriately (Which is to be expected from atleast a Dia player) and a Kat that is free to play the game how she likes, which is a very scary thing in low dia soloq

She can zone Kat because she's full mana. Anivia does respectable early damage it's just her mana costs that are really annoying.

She doesn't need to thin wave because if Kat is using spells to clear wave while under tower then her tower hits melees while ranged are just out of range of tower and Kat uses all her spells so even if Kat somehow kills all of Anivia's wave with her combo (which she can't without sitting there for like 6 autos which gives Anivia free harass) then Anivia can just tank the ranged minions anyway since she has full hp/mana and Kat can't harass under tower anyway besides throwing Q's which are irrelevant

She can't 100-0 Kat in one combo but she can take at least half her health at which point is enough to dissuade Kat from comboing wave again or even stepping up because of threat of jungle gank.

4524,5e3d861c98b1d71e96cd69e1,"In a matchup like this, it can be game break or make difference. Actually it can be in a lot of matchups, with current exp buffs, a solo laner can snowball like crazy on the opponent if they are allowed to freeze. 

It's a snowballing effect, the gold and exp denial can very quickly build up way over 500g earlygame and a level difference. Especially since Kat is absolutely horrendus at managing waves. Anivia could be hitting 6 to her lvl 5, that's a huge window where Anivia not only gets to bully her further, she practically becomes ungankable due to kat not providing enough damage or being able to set up a gank at all. This leads to recall advantages, recall advantages lead to item disparities OR (if kat recalls to match) even further gold/exp leads. It can shutdown Kats ability to roam or fight altogether and can put Anivia, who is a scaling champion, seriously far ahead. Being able to itemise defensive/scaling items early game in a matchup like this can actually just doom the game, imagine anivia sitting on Catalyst, tear and mercs or just mr cloak. Kat can never kill her nor can she roam away from the lane without sheer luck or teammates not listening to pings. She will lose plates and more gold/exp.  

When you have wave management advantage, that's how these massive leads build up and you don't even need to play it perfectly. Maybe Rookie gets a 40cs and 2-3lvl lead, but you could end up easily with a 20-30cs lead and 1-2 lvls ahead. This is by far enough to hardcarry even if your teammates int.  


All that being said, it's still 0 excuse to leave the game lol. But it is a game winning or losing matter for immobile mages, their reward for outtrading/harrassing/micro or whatever it could be, is generally lane state priority. As in they get to choose what happens for the next 2-3mins, they cannot force kills or skirmishes as easily so it's important they get to capitilise on this. An Irelia, Kat, Qiyana, Talon have a lot more opportunities to do other things when waves reset, whether it's recalling for long swords/doran's blades or roam/skirmish somewhere else.",Freezing in plat,2020-02-06 19:28:12

Bad jungler etiquette caused by tilted 6 game losing streak. Did anivia need to leave? No. Did Lee need to troll?

But depending on the type of player you are, the chance lowered makes the game potentially less worth the time.

League has become like this because it's an enormous time investment to not only play a game but also climb in ranked.

I could be catching up on a show or life instead of this. However, I value a League game more if the chance to win is 50-50 and I have a good game. When the game is made a 20-80 and my teammates are unpleasant, I might just choose to catch up on that show.

It's less about the win or loss and more about the value prop. If your goal is strictly climbing, you're right, but most people's goals are a combination of fun, climbing, and time.

Happened a lot last year since I was going through issues and League was/is an escape

I left games that were an obvious loss and gave ultimatums that if the FF doesn't go through, I would leave anyway so they'd have to FF later anyway

I just felt like it wasn't worth my time. Probably left perhaps 1/3 games on my main and 1/10 or 1/15 games on a smurf? 

Never got banned or leaverbuster, ever. 

The only time I'd been leaverbustered was like 5 years ago when I had network issues and those were in normal games lol

It did a lot more for my mental so I don't regret doing it.

About 1 second later i died under my turret. For the rest of the game if Kass was near, i literally could only ult and run, as even W range would get me killed. Top was an even lane, our jg was passive but it was fine because the enemy jg helped feed our lane. The middle kass turned a sure loss into a sure win specifically because our ziggs couldnt resist opening a highly successful restaurant in the mid lane.

Delays back timing by more than a wave

Tells Kat that Anivia's jungler is not out to help the lane

Allows Kat to wave-clear 2 waves safely before Anivia can touch a wave again

No one wants to do that for a bunch of internet strangers, even those who have good will.

Also don't try to pull out this ""pride and ego"" crap. There's a big difference between hard unwinnable games and games with people griefing on purpose. It's not egotistic to not want giving the troll the satisfaction/tolerance of letting them do shit like this and people need to realize that.

You're assuming facts not in evidence.  You don't know that the Lee was trolling; he may have done what he did out of pure stupidity, thinking he was helping.  He also could have been provoked by Anivia's indifference to him ganking her lane.  I've known plenty of players that do things to their teammates because they thought the were wronged.

First of all, bullshit.  Second of all, even if it were true that the lane was lost due to Lee's behavior, that does not mean that the game is lost.  There are other lanes in the game which can be won by the 3 other players on that team, and Lee could very well contribute to helping them win their lanes. Plus, this is the metal leagues where anything can happen.

Zven liked TSM, most fans liked him (many TSM fans still want him to do well), and it was just a shit situation that all 5 members were put in 2019. Literally every players performance dropped due to the stupid jungle shenanigans that management made the team go through. Was clear over the two years that the blame can go on several parties, and that includes Zven but is not limited to him, and even Zven agrees.

4832,5e3d863898b1d71e96cd6eb2,"If you think about it, C9 has a history of pretty much only hiring players who are good at communicating and are mature in a CERTAIN type of way. And by that I mean that all the C9 players historically have seemed humble, laid back, dedicated, open minded, intelligent, passionate about LoL, and able to be fairly eloquent. And they don't seem like selfish players. They will play whatever gives the team the best chance of winning. The only players I can think of who don't align with that are Hai (not humble) and Jensen (he is apparently a bit of a selfish player). But Hai and Jensen are both smart people who can speak well. Jensen also seems fairly laid back these days.

That's exactly the type of people you want to work with. Easy going people who aren't lazy and who aren't incompetent. I imagine that one of the absolute worst things to have on an eSports team is a player who cannot communicate well. And I'm not just talking about in-game comms. I'm talking about out-of-game communication as well. If someone cannot express themselves elegantly, then discussion is doomed. It's like trying to get blood from a stone. You can't solve problems when someone on the team is overly emotional, or too lazy, or unable to speak in an efficient way.

I feel like most teams have at least one of those guys on the roster. All LCS pros are *skilled* at the game, but I think there is huge variance on maturity and soft skills. And those skills probably matter quite a bit, since LCS these days is more a competition over who can find the most effective strategies the fastest and who can coordinate together the best to execute those strategies the best. Steve, co-CEO of TL, recently said that they try to hire players who are able to communicate complex things well. C9 seems to hire people who have a lot of good soft skills. When is the last time you saw a C9 player get interviewed and it was a bad interview? Nisqy maybe?

I’ve never talked shit about him on the sub even when he was face checking baron and I don’t feel strongly about him either way tbh. But Zven is a classic case of a good winner and a bad loser. And you can see it in the little things. His interviews when the team is doing well are always great. Honest, humble and even gracious. But when the teams doing shit he’s very passively snide in a way that rubs you the wrong way.

Take some of his summer split interviews about losing the spring final. He’d say something about how it was his fault but then spend the next few minutes breaking down everything everyone else did wrong and then end it with a but even if their mistakes were really bad I still think about mine more or smtg like that. That’s obviously going to cause people to push back. It’s almost cyclical at this point. He says something shitty about TSM, people rage about him, and then he says something nice about us and a different group of people praise him.

Sometimes things work and sometimes they just don't. Another good example is CLG worked in 2016, and the same exact roster didn't in 2017.

Jungle was the issue for TSM in spring 2018, not removing DL. Sure the on paper result makes it seem like the big mistake was the Doublelift Trade, but that was honestly looking like a superb move before the split and during most of spring.

Criticizing the Zven and Mithy signing is as stupid as criticizing the Yellowstar signing. There was ZERO reason to believe this was an erroneous move given all the available info at the time.

Time and time again he's accepted his part of the blame for when the team is not succeeding. Even now, he goes onto record saying he's part of the reason why the 2018-2019 TSM failed in the way they did, and that just because he's doing well now, does not mean the org or the assembly of players around him brought him down. 

At the same time, he's also saying that it is unfair for people to place all the burden of failure onto him as well. For example, in 2019 spring, people point to his 1 baron throw as the sole reason why they lost the series. He's said that yes, while it played a part of it, it is wrong to say it is the entire reason why. There were plenty points in time that other people in the team contributed to the loss, they just weren't as obvious a blunder.

4883,5e3d863b98b1d71e96cd6f7e,"> Take some of his summer split interviews about losing the spring final. He’d say something about how it was his fault but then spend the next few minutes breaking down everything everyone else did wrong and then end it with a but even if their mistakes were really bad I still think about mine more or smtg like that.



He did this in summoning insight in the offseason and one other interview towards the end of summer iirc (unless I'm mistaken, then link me the interview). That's not a big deal at all, you're allowed to talk about what went wrong after you've already left the team and be more open about what really happened there. Doublelift has done this, Bjerg has even done this in his reflections video. 



People are happy when they're doing well in something that they work towards every day? I'm shocked!



No one is sugarcoating or forgetting his time on TSM. He did well in 2018 spring, then had the worst series of his career against Clutch and TSM then lost in quarters. Zven is a very mentality based player - him being part of the team (and being such a big part with the 3 losses) that didn't take TSM to finals for the first time clearly affected him in summer.


He was up and down in summer, but still alright for the most part and he definitely picked it up for playoffs. TSM still lost but were clearly the 3rd best team in the region in 2018 summer.


Zven was great in 2019 spring after the initial 2-3 weeks of being meh, he carried that all the way through to playoffs and finals. Did well in finals apart from games 4/5 (but game 4 was everyone doing poorly), and of course people remember that. 


Summer...you can't even talk about that split objectively with what the team was doing with their junglers. Every player did poorly after a certain point","Zven on his impressive record, responds to Doublelift, defends TSM",2020-02-07 01:01:18

He often doesn't keep stuff behind the bush. American culture is different as especially northern Europe that can sometimes feel a bit cold or harsh. I'm pretty sure people in NA didn't like it when he said at RR that NA is shit. they wanted to hear a PR answer that NA will catch up and it's only because they are sick or not really trying.

I mean there was DL then the others. Sven threw a good number of games all by himself. He wouldn't have been a clear improvement in any other team.

&nbsp;

If we talk about his potential of course he's clear second. He's even #1 imho. But if we talk about his performances since he's in NA, his performances are not worth the money and import slot.

I'm curious to see if he's going to be able to be consistant with that level of performance through the split now.","Zven on his impressive record, responds to Doublelift, defends TSM",2020-02-07 12:24:03

Most people were TSM fans or haters from the jump with how much of a brand they developed, being the first to really start streaming and the reality BTS shows) , and as a result, this happens when one of if not the biggest brands in League turns into garbage with bad roster choices, infamous misplays, the world's streak ending in embarrassing ways, and the same playstyle that hasn't changed in a long time. A lot of old fans turn bitter when a brand or team goes downhill, so I don't get why people are surprised or thinking it's excessive when really what else do you expect from a brand that was the biggest in personality and best in the region for fucking 7 seasons and has slowly become more and more mediocre?","Zven on his impressive record, responds to Doublelift, defends TSM",2020-02-07 07:10:11

At the same time, I still think it is merely a product of him being truthful about his thoughts and opinions. If deflecting the blame or defending his actions were his primary motive, he would not go onto record so many times about how he could've done better, how he contributed to the negative atmosphere, etc... etc..

About the mithy thing, It's been a while since I watched that episode and I wasn't entire in tune while I was listening (I was doing some chore and my attention was split). So maybe I'm misremembering, or my subconscious added words or put sentences into my head that he did not say. So take my next little bit with a heavy pinch of salt.

I do think it was a bit too much when he insinuated that there was a reason why Mithy went back to EU and didn't perform and had to retire. However, he also said he wanted to go back to EU with mithy after the 2018 season, and that the only reason he couldn't was because TSM didn't let him. If he were truly trying to scapegoat Mithy, why would he want to continue playing with him? He also praised Mithy a lot, and credited a lot to his early development as a player to Mithy's guidance. 

So yeah, his words were harsh. But, I interpret more as 'I acknowledge that mithy's mechanics are declining, and it was a problem,' rather than 'Mithy sucks and that's why we sucked.' Which to me, is part of being truthful.

However, everyone's perception to everything is different. We live through our interpretation of the events that unfold. I perceive his words and intentions as him being truthful, and you see it otherwise.

That's not the reason TSM gets the level of hate it does. It's also not due to success, because FNC and G2 have had their share of successes, and also have large fanbases. FNC fans get shit on occasionally, but not nearly to the level that TSM has had to go through.

In my opinion, it simply became fashionable to hate on TSM after Summoning Insight. Like, as a fan, before SI the atmosphere on the subreddit towards TSM and their fanbase felt much different than the attitude that came after their \~1 year tenure.

SI covered every team in NA almost every episode, shit on all the teams except for being a little more non-committal towards C9 and CLG (understandable, since Monte was their coach), only they spent about double the time every episode shitting on TSM, often including the fans, whom they loved to joke at the expense of. I still remember S4 worlds, when the group stages were covered on different weekends. TSM didn't even play on the second weekend, but SI spent almost as much time shitting on TSM in their second episode as they did talking about C9, who was the team who had actually played that weekend. In fact, iirc they spent about 15 minutes memeing about how much TSM was going to fail against SSW, and then like 2 minutes on how C9 would lose to SSB, cut & dry with no memes. Literally. That's the kind of gap we're talking about. Both teams had laughable chances, but the tone was just completely different when it came to how they covered TSM.

But you can't argue something as abstract as tone, so there was always plausible deniability. As the only real analytical content back then, SI was basically gospel on the subreddit, and it's no wonder their spin on TSM became ingrained in people's perceptions.

Grig isn't that leader, thinker or superbrain in the jungle and I think TSM always had this dissonance between the jungler they had and the jungler they thought they have. And for DIG I see that they completly understand the abilities, but also the limits of Grig as a player and use him accordingly. 

For TSM it always seemed they wanted Akaadian to be a little less like Akaadian and Grig a little less like Grig, but if you have Grig and Akaadian, you have Grig and Akaadian, you can't mesh them up into Grikaadian.

All the tank junglers have problems defending against the Olafs of the world because they can't outduel many champions.  Amumu isn't a particularly worse defender of his own jungle than most of the other tanks.  In fact, he has some distinct advantages - he generally clears faster and healthier than a lot of tank junglers, and while he isn't a good dueler, he isn't as bad early as many make him out to be.

But the big issue is that he is really hosed by the loss of early game jungle objectives.  A lot of junglers can shrug off the loss of a blue as a bit of lost XP.  Amumu has real mana issues without it.  Scuttles work similarly - the mana burst is really useful early (Amumu isn't very good at scuttles, but he is better than some jungle tanks like Zac).

Now these accounts were not banned, they were stolen and I never got them back. I literally see other people playing on them. Leveling my 3rd account as we speak. I wish it was a security issue on my part because I would have lost other stuff too.

I did however try to make the make up and the overal vibe match officer caitlyn which indeed is not a very complex skin. The gun is pretty expensive to make and imo rather plain for a caitlyn gun. I will be making her classic gun since that one is a lot cooler I think! I did still want to cosplay this skin though since it's my fav Cait skin.

5762,5e3d868698b1d71e96cd7d3e,"Resets CD's are all important in pro play, being down several ults makes that 2v5 much easier than just a straight up out play. Again full credit to them, but it's not like they were up against morde and lee sin ults etc, In fact I think only thresh had their ult left.

It makes the fight much safer and easier to kite around, when abilities are on CD.

If there was Ornn horn, lee sin kick, Morde ult, and the aphelios explosion to deal with, it wouldn't have been won.

&#x200B;

Again full credit to the players, they knew ults were down and danced on the outside of opponents engage range to ensure max dmg output. But it's not the grand 2v5 outplay, it's the second half of a team fight in which your opponent has expended their most valuable ults. 

Also they are down half the hp at the start of OP's clip, so there was a substantial amount of that 15k dmg done before the clip starts, but starting the clip before the timestamp shown makes it look like a teamfight rather than a 2v5, that's my complaint.",Mystic and Fly find a 2v5,2020-02-07 01:17:56

Frontline pushes forward, takes the engage and draws aggro, backline puts out consistent dps. I think the whole clip shows the how well a backline who doesn't overpush to engage with the opponents backline is extremely strong. 

It shows great awareness and positioning from the adc and mid laner. 

But even if you want to say the frontline played badly (and the argument is certainly there to be made) they did absorb GRF's ults, and primary damage abilities, which gives the backline an opportunity. 

My point is it's not a clean 2v5 because there are several abilities on CD, and watching the longer clip shows the backline kiting GRF while they are engaged on rumble etc.

ADCs were getting one-shot by anything and anyone (it kinda still happens, but you won't just always get run down though). ADCs were mainly relegated to utility, so you almost never saw pros picking hard-carry ADCs like Twitch, Kog'Maw, Tristana, etc. Every game it was Ashe, Varus, Jhin and sometimes very rarely, Lucian.

Not to mention how ridiculously dumb Assassins were during that time. I believe Assassin rework also dropped during that time, so all of them very quiet over-tuned. Additionally, GA was still a tank item, so you couldn't just buy it if you were constantly getting engaged on. And yeah, of course, no stopwatch too. Those were hard days as an immobile champ...

Worst of the bunch were the Tanks tbh. No one except the ADCs could realistically kill them, and ADCs were the ones who couldn't ever live enough to hurt them. It was very common to see raid-boss Maokais running around during those times...",Mystic and Fly find a 2v5,2020-02-06 21:24:24

I think you are misinterpreting what talent means. He has always had the potential to become a great player regardless of whether he stayed in the LCK or moved to the LPL, which means that his talent is not the product of being in the LPL, but the fact that he is simply talented. Otherwise, why would the LPL import so many Korean players before they make a huge impact on the scene? And why would players like Teddy, who was also a talented adc stuck in JAG, picked up the most prestigious team in the LCK, maybe even the world?",Mystic and Fly find a 2v5,2020-02-07 12:08:26

At the end of the day I just don't really think it's okay for a professional player to not be able to play the best champs in their role, even if their team can somehow make up for it.
