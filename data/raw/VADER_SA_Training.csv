A friend of mine taught me the basics. Now I think I understood the game in general (Runes, Items, Phases, Counters, ...) and I fell in love with mid and support, especially Zoe and Pyke/Blitzcrank.

1. Why is it, that after the laning phase, so many teamfights shift into the jungle? I mean, when there is a drake up or something it kind of makes sense to me. But so many times my team splits up in the jungle and getting f\*cked one by one. Is there a deeper meaning I just don't understand?
2. Are there any hotkeys that are commonly used? By now, I only use hotkeys for active items and skills/summoner spells. I read something about a hotkey for attacking the next enemy and stuff. Is there any ""hidden"" control stuff I should know about?
3. How can you tell (without checking guides and stuff) which stats scale the best with certain champs? For example: Mundo with an AP build is BS. But how do you know that?

I've been playing league since early 2012 and this is the one champion they've released where I've had continued problems trying to recognize their abilties.

For most champion's kits, I can understand it within a game usually. I either play the champion in a solo custom game or now in practice tool and can grasp what they do pretty quickly.

I remember reading the tooltips for the updated abilities for the Akali and Irelia reworks and being a little bit confiused about how the champion as a whole would play, but as soon as I played it and played against it, it quickly made sense.

When Qiyana was revealed I thought her abilities were confusing until I played just a few minutes as her and it near instantly made sense.

Even for champions that I hadn't bought yet, playing a game against them would usually bring about the champion's typical playstyle and I'd be able to figure out what they're capable of and what their weaknesses are.

Aphelios breaks this pattern for me. I've played against him a handful of times and I still don't know what he does. I understand things like Infernum is the aoe gun and Crescendum is like a boomerang that does a lot of damage and that he also has this weapon that slows you, but my understanding of it really ends there. 

The symbols by the champion are hard to recognize. How do I know which weapon he has in his off-hand? Do I need to just play more and more games against him to associate their very unlear symbols by his health bar with the weapon he's using?",0.9801,17.9,73.8,17.9

Assuming that the kill provides 300 gold, it makes more sense to have a teammate try and assist or even ks to get the extra 150 gold siphoned into the team. 

When I play roles like Jungler, I sometimes get asked why I even try to damage a champion that is going to die. I try explaining that 450 gold is better than 300 gold and that I try to only aim for assists so that the carries will get the 300 portion.

That being said, it seems odd to me to have us be incentivized to get assists for an extra 150 gold while not providing extra gold for those good solo kills. I assume it's to prevent snowballing and to encourage team play (which I am all for), but there should be a nice middle ground for this.

With kills on other players. you get more gold for getting the kill, but there is still assist gold. Certain items are good on certain champions, as each of them has scalings on his abilities that scale with a certain type of damage (ad or ap), and also certain item special passives or actives synergize with a champions kit. However, there is still room for personal preference and adaptation to the enemy team. For starters, I reccomend websites such as u.gg for items until you figure out how they work. There are teamcomps such as dive or deathball, but due to the massive amount of champions (150) they are not limited to a certain character and can be played with many interchangeable champions",0.9727,22.6,66.0,22.6

Feel free to clarify on everything else.

> If you get the final blow, you get gold, but if you don't you get no reward at all?

You get assist gold, but not the bonus bounty from last-hitting an enemy who had bounty. Assists are granted within helping kill an enemy within the last 10 seconds, and assist gold is split between how many champions helped kill (usually 150g in total, then split, unless the enemy is feeding.)

> Are there items that are good for certain comps or champs?

Well, yes, there's items such as thornmail which is good against AD champions that primarily auto-attack, and it's good on someone like Rammus who has a taunt that forces the enemy to auto-attack him. Useful against high AD auto champions like Master Yi and Draven because they practically kill themselves. There's magic resist items for magic-damage champions, armor for attack-damage champions, and health for (most...) true damage champions. Certain champions prefer other items, but generally items are fairly diverse, and most if not all AP champions enjoy Morellonomicon for example. There are also support-specific items that help champions that heal/shield allies such as ardent censor, redemption, etc if you prefer to support and peel others off the carries.

As for your first question, I can't say I completely get it but most of the roles have been consistent in the sense they're played and meta year-round, but sometimes things sneak in such as mages being played bot, in place of the ADC (the marksman/attack damage carry that goes botlane with the Support) position, because of what some mages can provide, such as Syndra.",0.996,28.599999999999998,58.3,28.599999999999998

The two have completely different mindsets. Given how technical League is and the mental of much of its player base, people rarely build for the team composition and instead focus on champs they’re mechanically good with (think the guy that can only play hanzo and refuses to swap). Team composition in League is much more focused around maximizing the potential of the random 5 champs you have rather than always building a team of 5 to specifically synergize with one another, especially since a large portion of the game is played with each individual team member mostly being on their own for some time. You certainly can try to build a synergistic team comp, but since learning to play a champ well takes more time than it does in OW, building a pool to choose from is more difficult. That said, tanks and supports typically have the most success playing with larger pools rather than sticking to one specifically.

Peeling and creating space is a tank (top) or caster support role. Sort champions by tank or support and you’ll see a good spread of options you can look at to see what works best for you. Since mobility is way more valuable in this game than OW, most tanks and peel champions are slower (no ball here).

Kills (the person who strikes the final blow) award kill gold, and assist gold is distributed to anyone who helped. Assists can be as involved as doing 90% of the damage or as simple as healing one involved party member before the fight. The gold is less, but still significant. The larger victory of a kill is removing an enemy from play for an extended period of time, since League has death timers that increase as the game goes on.

There are specific team “comps” where champions’ kits all align to a specific goal. “Dives” in our case are teams with large amount of engage, mobility, and cc, paired with burst damage to quickly kill enemies. “Deathballs” are typically just your large tanks peeling for your smaller damage dealers (carries as we call them).

Happy to answer any other questions. If you let me know what heroes in OW you play I’d be happy to recommend you some similar champs.",0.9909,21.8,65.7,21.8

3) you cant, league is a complex game and many champs have different builds and can shift from one playstyle to another. For example shaco can go ap/ad or hybrid. Nautilus was played tank for years and suddeny people started playing him full ap. Itemization is dependend on meta and game state, you need to look up what is best in this meta, no way around that.

In Higher elos there are a nubmer of reasons but most common is setting up vision for an objective that will be contested later on (baron drake etc), or for example when one jungler is ahead and predicts the other will be clearing this or that camp he goes to disrupt/get the kill/ get the camp.

2. Honestly dont know about the attack hotkey but the important ones are f2-f5 which swotch the map view to your teammates (in the order they appear above your minimap) i changed the hotkeys here a bit and they go:
I put the summoners on MB4 and MB5 (mouse side buttons)
Active items i ussually only have 2 max 3(rarely) and i put them on S,  D and F
Abd i put the teammate view switcg on numbers

3. You will be able to know kinda intuitively when get to that point, but for most champs you will already learn through playing before you get to the point of intuition. If you are new i would suggesz to focus on roles you play, as you said mid and supp and learn through guides and videos the most common champs. Then evolve the knowledge from there. Most important thing there is the ap/ad ratio of the champs abilities, primarily the ability he relies upon the most.

The symbol by the HP bar is only his main-hand weapon, and they're colour coded as well as shaped like what they do (Infernum is a blue flame, for example, and Gravitum is a purple orb.)

There's a slight tint in his ultimate for which effect it's casting, but it isnt very visible unless you pay attention to it. His off-hand is also shown on his back of his model while his main-hand is in his hand with a unique stance. So far this is the only way you can tell, until or if it gets updated, which I wouldn't be surprised seeing the most recent pro game.

As for his guns, the hotlinks are the icons for each gun so you know what they are next to his HP bar:

**[Calibrum](https://i.imgur.com/KhTQzmJ.png) - Sniper Rifle - Green:** Gains range. 

**Q:** Shoots a projectile that will mark you if hit and then allows him to auto you for extra damage and proc his off-hand weapon (Current ""global"" if marked, but being nerfed to 2000.)

-

**[Severum](https://i.imgur.com/mD6YtpR.png) - Scythe Pistol - Red:** Heals for % of damage dealt, excess healing functions like Overheal and becomes a shield lasting for 30 seconds. 

**Q:** Gains movement speed and rapidly attacks using main and offhand weapon for a few seconds, dealing damage and can crit. He cannot auto during this animation.

-

**[Gravitum](https://i.imgur.com/C5PaKTe.png) - Gravity Cannon - Purple:** Autos apply a decaying slow. 

**Q:** Anyone effected by the slow is damaged and will be rooted for 1 second.

-

**[Infernum](https://i.imgur.com/NCZQ5f5.png) - Flamethrower - Blue:** Attacks are AOE and deal 110% AD damage and 75-100% to secondary targets, reduced vs minions. Crits fire more bolts and deal bonus damage. 

**Q:** Sprays a cone dealing damage then throws out a volley of his off-hand weapon at each enemy hit by the cone. Applies on-hit.

-

**[Crescendum](https://i.imgur.com/bxmgdHj.png) - Chakram - White:** Autos are a chakram and he can't auto until it returns to him, the closer you are to him the faster the chakram attacks because of the return rate. Using an ability that would require him to throw the chakram throws a spectral one instead and he can catch it and increase the amount of chakrams he has (up to 20, lasts 5 seconds.) Autos with the chakram are empowered and do more damage based on number of chakrams and the bonus damage can crit. 

**Q:** Places a turret that applies his off-hand weapon, scales off his ad crit and attack speed. Akin to a Zyra plant (deactivates when not attacking, then will die out after a few seconds.

I'll give you some of my personal opinions and will include at the end my choice for easiest  champion and easy champion that could play every role. To give you an understanding of my personal knowledge of the game I can say that at my peek I was Platinum 2, but quit during my climb due to personal reasons. 

There are a lot of more basic/good starting champions. Some for each role would include:


Top- Garen, Renekton, Dr. Mundo, Cho'Gath, and Teemo.


Jungle- Amumu, Master Yi, Xin Zhao, and Nunu.


Mid- Annie, Malzahar, Ryze (kinda), and if you are a skillshot master then try Xerath (I used him to climb rank a lot during the low elos, but he is VERY skillshot  intensive).


ADC- Miss Fortune, Sivir, Ashe, Tristana, and Ezreal (though Ezreal is harder as he is skillshot-based, but if you learn him he is one of the safest ADCs).


Support- Leona, Yuumi (easiest champion in the game imo), Soraka (kinda beginner friendly), and Braum (though he is an easy to learn, hard to master champion).

Easiest champion (in my opinion)- Yuumi. You literally sit on your ADC and do some skills, but don't have as much pressure of moving alone.

Easy champion that can play all roles- Teemo. While it is a running meme that Teemo is evil, Teemo is versatile enough to be able to play any role.

I have something to add to your answers:
2) When I have a shield spell it automatically uses it on myself if I don't target an ally. Isn't that the same? Only issue I can see is if my cursor is somehow over an ally and I want to use the spell on myself (which didn't happen until now, but I can see the risk of it)

4) My account was created in the early states of the game. I played a couple games back then. Wasn't the old system that you gain points after every match which you can invest in new heroes? Why is that worse than only getting points on a level up? 

And another thing about the keybinds:
I tried to bind ""Enemy has vision here"" on I think it was alt+leftclick or ctrl+leftclick. But somehow the game always resets that option as soon as I join a match. Why?",0.8875,14.099999999999998,79.2,14.099999999999998

One of the first things i starzed paying attention to is your teammates hp bar above the minimap. If they are low or lowering i look at the minimap to see their position in lane(who is pushing who) then if the enemies are the ones extending to our side of the lane i switch camera to determine if i can gank or not. Thats my primary task for camera switch, better players probably have more cases. Other one is if you start playing champs with global ults(draven, ezreal, jinx, senna, gangplank, soraka) or semi-global (xerath, galio, ziggs) then you need the info on enemy champs health which you get by fast camera switch when you see your teammates are in fights.
One important thing, in 99% of the cases you need to push in your wave before roaming to gank/help (also known as geting prio) by clearing the enemy minions in your lane. That will force your opponent to deal with your minions and you get to the other place first, or he loses an entire wave which is extremly valuable to you cazse you create gold diff in your lane.

The math is really simple, when you execute with your ult he gets the same amount of money as you, so the amount of gold given for the same kill is DOUBLED. You as supp get lower income from the start and this is the thing what keeps you afloat cause pyke isnt a utility support but a roamer and assasin. 
Second thing is that when enemys hp is below threshold you -execute- him, meaning the dmg is true and not physical. If your friend wants to play for kills you need a different support, my reccomendation is blitz naut or thresh because they cc  and disrupt enemies for a longer time.

Also very important thing that adcs often forget, when you hook someone its not an immediate ""LEAVE EVERYTHING AND ALL IN"". your hook is excellent as poke as well. The all in happenes when you hook and then stun cause it puts you in the middle of your oppobents.

One more thing i hope you know but i see alot of players do wrong is the escape with pyke. You always always want to E first and then W.

For Sivir she has a good wave clear and a spellshield to block her from any spells like Thresh/Blitz hook or even ultimates. For Support I'd go with Alistar or Leona also easy to use champions. 

Also for now I wouldn't focus on mid lane or jungle since they are hard without too much game knowledge since in mid you can be ganked like from every angle and a against a good midlaner it can be discouraging.

If you want to know what happend : Aphelios stacked his Crescendum's (white) chakrams with his ult, Rush then proceeded to ult this stacked Aphelios with his ult while his Q was on CD, thus dying in the process. (on a side note : Aphelios with Crescendum is really hard for assassins because he can DPS them really fast when in close range, so unless your have all your CDs up as an assassin, don't jump on him). 

Then, Aphelios proceeded to use his Severum's (red) Q to kite and dodge Thresh hooks thanks to the MS buff it gives, all while stacking his chakrams even more. At this point, Aphelios has a lot of stacks on his Crescendum (white) so all you need to do is back off and wait for his chakrams to go off, It literally only last for 5 seconds, so if ennemy team just waited 5 seconds, they would all have been fine and Aphelios couldn't do anything. 

Alternatively, using Severum's (red) Q made him switch weapon into his Calibrum (green), and because he already had Crescendum stacks, he could use Crescendum turrets Q with it as a combo. Again, Rushs team didn't respect it and chased him into the turrets while he had fully stacked Crescendum (white) instead of just backing off for literally 5 SECONDS. 

I know sometimes Aphelios lacks clarity (especially on his ultimate), but please, his chakrams being stacked is one of the clearest thing in the game, and the counterplay really is that easy. 

Aphelios is actually pretty balanced now, he's kinda of a jack of all trade ADC with clear strengths, but also very clear weaknesses and counterplays, if people just took 10 MINUTES to read his abilities or try them in practice mode, everybody would understand what he does and how to counter him.",0.9773,11.0,86.5,11.0

>Obviously doesn't read about new champions because the interaction shown in the video is described on multiple sites.

Aphelios's Chakram turret (Q) marks champions depending on what weapon he has as his secondary.
Aphelios's Calibrum (sniper rifle) marks champions so that he can attack the mark once, globally. 

Aphelios's Chakram gains a stacking damage bonus in the form of up to 20 additional chakrams when Aphelios uses a skill that throws his chakram.

Aphelios used Severum Q (the lifesteal weapon that looks like a sickle) which makes him attack with both weapons, stacking his chakram damage which he then switches to to get the ridiculous damage on his auto attacks.

This community needs to stop with the willful ignorance when they're complaining about champions, it makes us all look stupid. Is Aphelios broken and overloaded? Fuck yeah.

What I will give Aphelios players, is that his damage, except inferno ult, is what you might expect from an ADC. The problem is that you are missing all the cues that every other champion has, so you have an idea of what to look out for. 

Champion needs a visual rework ASAP, because this isn't a question of understanding what he does, it is a question of even being able to tell what he is doing in a way that is possible to process in the heat of the moment. I know what he can do, I can tell why this clip makes sense, but that's impossible to tell during a teamfight.

And I say this as someone who hasn't bothered learning to play him yet at all, with 3 games total so far. 

Clarity is the main issue by far, and I am 99% sure most of the problems that people have with him, is entirely on the visual aspect, not his actual numbers, even if people tunnel too hard on his damage potential. By and large, he isn't *that* much worse than certain other champions, but he currently have a massive advantage in that the player knows what is going on, and the enemy team does not. Even if you CAN figure it out during replays, that's not enough. You really need to be instantly aware of what he can do, and what he is even doing, at any given moment. Riot failed on that point. If everything was perfectly clear at a glance, in 99% sure Aphelios would be balanced at best, and even too weak at worst.

Each gun has its own ability. Each gun will change the effect of the ult depending on which is equipped. 

He can have two guns equipped at once and they will effect each other. This means he can use the sniper rifle to mark people, which will also proc the effect of the second weapon, for example, the dagger which life steals.

He can do this with any combination of weapons. 

1. **Sniper rifle** is a long distance skill shot that marks whoever it hits. You can then right click them from any distance to get a free auto attack. The ult will mark everyone hit, and then hit all of them with an auto attack.
2. **Gravity cannon** is a skill that when you hit someone with an auto/other ability, you can then slow/root them with the ability. The ultimate marks anyone hit, which will slow them, and then a follow up root can be applied with the active ability. 
3. **Dagger** steals life when it hits. The ability rapidly attacks while moving for lowered damage, it will also rapidly proc the off hand guns effect. It only really does anything with Chakram, however. The ultimate just steals a bunch of life from everyone hit by it.
4. **Chakram** attacks faster the closer you are. The ability places a turret. The turret will proc the effect of the secondary gun. This is particularly strong with the sniper rifle since anyone that gets hit by the turret, will then be hit with an infinite ranged auto attack as well. The Chakram also has the passive ability to gather chakrams which increases his auto attack damage. You get them by hitting people with off hand abilities while having Chakram equipped, or by hitting them with the Chakram ultimate. 
5. **Flamethrower** is basically a shotgun. The ability fires a wave of flame. The ultimate will fire a ring of fire around anyone hit by the ultimate. Lots of AOE damage.


Now just mix and match every gun and that's Aphelios, it's not too bad to understand, you just have to spend a bit more time reading about him than other champs because this information is horribly conveyed in game.

I'll quote it for you to eliminate the confusion

> Being good at playing a certain character in a video game is valuable, but I think I'll take the 200+ collective years of professional game design experience.


> > but I think I'll take the 200+ collective years of professional game design experience.

> > > years of professional game design experience.

> > > > professional game design experience

> > > > > game design

If you agree with it or not, that's the entire point. You see the comma in the middle of the sentence? It separates the two observations he made: 

The first one is that the other guy only has experience playing League of Legends.

The second one is that Riot's employees have experience in game design.

So not, by *that logic* riot does not have to let you balance the game, cause the users of this subreddit only play the game, but have no idea about game design.

Honestly, I don't think that's what makes him bad, though. Like the concept of an ADC who's good at a *little bit of everything* but excellent at nothing is a great idea on paper. Being able to swap between a weaker version of Ashe's slow and Cait's long-range attack offers some interesting play, since you're never going to be as self-peeling as Ashe nor as good with long-range DPS like Cait, but you *can* do both.

The problem is that he's got five million interactions between his ult/Q's/weapons that it's a fucking enigma to figure out what he's going to do next, and ultimately all you have to do is right click and win, which doesn't take the sort of analytical mindset that people assumed it would when they thought he would be LoL's Invoker.

>Cooldown increased to 150 / 120 / 90 seconds from 120 / 90 / 60.

These are the last two non-bug fix patches that have attempted to deal with those issues. They've been trying for years.

It's hard to balance rend without setting a maximum cap on things like baron/dragon, but that doesn't even fix the problem. She'd still have an excellent secure because she effectively increases the smite in organized play. You'd have to completely remove her damage to epic monsters, which makes taking dragons/baron almost impossible as all she builds is attack speed and crit.

As for her ult saving the support too often, all they could do to fix that is either A: increase the cd and make her completely unviable because it won't be up for fights, or force the support to be out of combat, which again, makes her unviable, though this time mostly because her post-5 laning would be horrendous without a mage support who's already ahead.

That aside, her ult saving the support isn't the biggest huge issue in the highest levels of play, as you can play around a Kalista not having ult and a support being chunked. You *cannot* play around a 2K damage smite.",0.9261,18.3,68.89999999999999,18.3

There's two components, reducing your HP and adding that max to Mordekaiser (going from 2000 to 1800 max HP) and both adding this 200 HP to Mordekaiser as a ""heal"" (otherwise it would be useless for Mordekaiser to jump from 3000 max hp to 3200 if you don't actually give him the HP to fill the new upper limit) and subtracting it from his target's current HP (otherwise it wouldn't deal damage if the target's current HP <90%).

Edit: This explanation was a bit messy. Mordekaiser ult does the following things:

* Set his target's max possible HP to 90% of its value. E.g. from 2000 max HP to 1800.
* Add that same amount to his own max possible HP. If Morde has 3000 HP, ulting that 2000 HP target will set his max HP to 3200.
* Deal damage to his target equal to 10% of their max HP. This is separate from the aforementioned HP total modification, so if he ults a full HP target they'll actually be dealt 20% max HP, essentially.
* Heal himself for an amount equal to 10% of his target's max HP.

Ok, let's assume he have ult. He need to get out of fight and get rid of a green gun (so he loses Cait shots & safe range) or white gun (to lose turrets and most valuable 1v1 instrument in his kit). Then, after 50 autos (or 30 autos + 2 spells with 8 sec cd), his rotation will give him this terrifying blue gun. Finally!

For example, during 2019 Spring Sneaky had 8.9 CSM and 8.5 during the Summer. In comparison, Zven had 9.5 CSM at Spring with 9.1 CSM at Summer.  (Doublelift had highest CSM at 10.3 during Spring, Cody Sun had highest CSM at 9.5 during Summer)

No offense to Sneaky, but his stats are what I will expect from a player in a low-tier team and even if these stats difference may be small, it will be substantial against top-tier teams.                                                                                                                                                                         If we want to compare CSD@15, Sneaky had an average of -6 CSD@15 while Zven had +2 CSD@15 during Spring. During Summer, Sneaky had an average of -6 CSD@15 while Zven had -7 [CSD@15](mailto:CSD@15). (Stats are at [gol.gg](https://gol.gg))                                                                                                                               However Sneaky was on Cloud 9 who reached 2nd place in Spring and Summer while Zven was on TSM who reached third and fourth place in Spring and Summer. Shouldn't it be obvious which player should receive higher expectations on their level of performance in pro play? Even in recent times, there are memes about ""Sneaky in lane,"" popularized by Doublelift in 2016 who said Sneaky is trash in lane (but good in teamfights) and to some extent there is some truth in what Doublelift says.

There may be a bit of recency bias here, but I do believe Zven will be a better mechanical player and most consistent than Sneaky, because Zven has always been regarded as a top tier adc (during his G2 and Origen years) by many pros which tells you something about his mechanical prowess while also showing an insane work ethic. In S9, Zven has played around 1806 games in NA solo que ([https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9%20Zven](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9%20Zven)) while Sneaky has played around 1262 games ([https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+Sneaky](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+Sneaky) including his smurf C9 Gun). During S9, Zven has around 1439 games played in S9 while Sneaky has around 1200 games. Also these are just the amount of Solo q games he has played in NA. Zven also has a EUW account ([https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+ZV3N](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+ZV3N)) where he played around 403 games in S8 and around 270 games in S9. Even if C9 does poorly in some games, I don't think it will stop them from being a potentially top 3 team (most likely top 2 as they always had in the past) in NA as they have such a strong showing in the first two weeks with good chemistry and macro play and I believe that Zven will perform consistently well in his future games at C9.

TLDR: Zven has always been a consistent and good mechanical ad carry even with his mishaps at TSM.",0.9865,13.700000000000001,78.5,13.700000000000001

After a decade of trophy-less splits, Regi finally uses his ultimate move, a suicide attack of sorts. Bjergsen had demanded - no, begged him to reconsider. But in that forlorn TSM house, empty save for Regi and Bjerg, the former team owner just just put his hand on his son's shoulder, and with sad eyes said, ""fuck it, baylife"". He put a slip of paper into Bjergsen's hands, then walked out the door.

That was the last Bjergsen ever saw of Reginald.

That was then, this is now. Bjergsen checks and rechecks the address Regi had handed him - his last gift. He looks back up, takes a deep breath...

Bjergsen walks up the sidewalk and knocks on the door. It opens. Bjerg gasps. No matter how many times he's seen her, the woman's beauty always leaves him breathless.

""I've been expecting you"", Sneaky says, and Bjergsen enters the C9 house.

Sneaky leads Bjergsen through the hall, down a staircase, into the deep dark pits of the cellar. Their in the darkness are three chairs, and 2 men.

""Doublelift?"" Bjergsen is confused. ""But the curse...""

Doublelift raises his eyes to meet Bjergen's gaze. ""...if never winning the split again is the price I must pay, I will gladly take it."" Bjergsen nods in understanding. He was prepared to make the same sacrifice.

They both turn to the third man.

Reapered sits, a human face so clearly housing something more than human. His eyes are deep and void, a window into the mind full of forbidden draft technologies and butthole jokes in broken English. ""Are you ready?""

""Yes"", C9's new mid and bot say in unison.

Bjergsen was bullied BAD. It's well-documented and comes straight from himself: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=676609642362402&id=485525748137460&sfnsn=mo

As for what people praise about him it only takes listening to Parth or Loco talk about him in one of the many long-form interviews/shows to get a sense of how superficially he's the PERFECT player. The perfect teammate. Everything a coach could ask for. Yet every other player TSM places around him always crumbles and can't perform.

This is not unrelated. The fandom or staff's belief that Bjergsen can do no wrong is not random trivia. It contributes to the workplace environment whether intentional or not.

Bjergsen is the consistent performer on TSM. Everyone else underperforms.

Even TSM fans now say something is wrong with TSM as an org instead of putting Bjergsen through more scrutiny.

Now instead of reconsidering their mid position, they offer Bjergsen unprecedented pro player career stability in partial team ownership. People think the Huni contract is overkill? Even Faker would never get Bjergsen's level of special treatment by his org: he had to share the stage with another mid remember?

TSM is gonna get worse before it gets better. This will exacerbate the problem, not solve it. Dardoch thought Loco gave Piglet special treatment on TL... Boy he's in for a ride with TSM now.

Bjergsen is inscrutable within TSM and that didn't happen by accident. If he was really hungry for the win/recognition as a pro player on the world stage he would've voluntarily switched teams or even tried going back to EU to prove himself. He knows he'd be dumb to give up what he has at TSM. It's not loyalty. The chances of getting another org wrapped around a player's finger to this extent are slim to none.",-0.7303,8.200000000000001,81.8,8.200000000000001

Wildturtle having multiple titles with TSM doesn't count?

I agree that there is something wrong but you need to grab the right straws. 

I would blame TSM's management even more (not to say they have been doing something wrong with whatever the fuck happened to this team's playstyle after that spring split) if Zven didn't just play bad individually as well from his first season with them, watch the playoffs vs CG and just watch how he positions, watch the regular?/playoffs? games in the next split vs C9 (especially when he's on Varus WITH A TAHM KENCH) and he still goes melee range under C9 turret to auto it and brings C9 back in the game which begins the reverse sweep iirc.

I am glad he is doing good now and doesn't feel the same pressure as before, but chalking it up to a simple ""TSM dark arts forced him to be bad as an INDIVIDUAL"" is something a lot of people are doing now but it's not that simple.

According to who? Biofrost was Top 3 on TSM, Biofrost was Top 3 on CLG, Biofrost has been playing very well since his return. I dont really see that as outperforming but if youre trying to fit a narrative i guess it works.

That is the only one on your list where i agree, Mithy played alot better post TSM than he did on TSM, but tbf on OG he didnt have to teach his jungler how to play the game while playing support himself.

In retrospect you can easily say that it was a bad move, but at the time it looked like a clear upgrade.  


And my point about the DL, Rekkles and Perkz wasn't to prove that he's not better than them, but that FNC and G2 needed a specific style, champ pool and consistency from their bot laners, and DL doesn't match them when it comes to that, hence the weak point (he's better than them at other stuff, but I struggle to think of an EU team that would put that to use).",0.3574,14.899999999999999,72.7,14.899999999999999

Not from this season.

Okay, but the gist of my points still apply. DMG% is heavily influenced by champion pool, where the team invests resources, team macro, etc. It's too context dependent to use as a marker of skill. 

> Jensen has already proven himself to be capable of carrying a team, like he did on C9 for several years. Nisqy has neither done that in EU nore has he done it in NA. 

Nisqy has though, ""playoff Nisqy"" was already a meme in EU because he was a monster in playoffs. Specifically in 2018 spring playoffs he hard carried his team to top 3. He also got player of the series in their B05 vs CLG last split. 

> Should we call a supportive roleplayer toptier in their respective roles? I'd argue we cant, because otherwise he would be carrying the burden in the team.

Supportive players still carry burdens, just different ones than dmg dealers. Being the main engage for the team is a burden, absorbing pressure without dying is a burden, having good roam timings is a burden, being a shotcaller is a burden, knowing where to be on the map is a burden, etc. 

It's why someone like Mata, a support player, is considered the 2nd best player of all-time. Or if you want a mid example, Kuro is easily a top 10 mid all-time and better than loads of carry mid laners because he's so phenomenal at his supportive style.",0.9721,19.3,69.5,19.3

He can burst them with the right setup and an ambush but his dps is just not that high. His gravitum, infernum, and calibrum guns are just not as good as other adcs' steroids in terms of dps. In this way, I would say he is punished for not having the right gun. 
If he lacks infernum, outside of buying runaan's his damage in teamfights is limited to single target, which makes it hard to carry a fight. 
Not having Severum or Crescendum + Gravitum could cause you to die to the enemy assassin without a chance to resist. 

Getting a switch to Gravitum in a late game fight might as well be the same as getting a dead hand because you're not going to be able to get rid of 50 ammo anytime soon, and the weapon is subpar when the enemy is not running or melee and immobile. Getting Crescendum is pretty nice most of the time, except it actually negatively affects your dps when chasing. 

I would say Severum is probably the gun that is the best for most situations (has overheal, sustain, dps while kiting, and synergizes well with every gun except maybe Infernum). 

Gravitum is extremely good offhand with low ammo in almost every situation, but terrible in main hand unless you don't have to worry about your damage. The weapon is just slow. It's like Jinx rocket without everything that makes it good, replaced with a slow, which isn't bad, just makes it bad for dps. Which is why you apply the slow with any weapon other than Gravitum. I don't know if riot wants every gun to be equally balanced but if so then I think gravitum needs a buff to make it usable in main hand. Lower the slow if needed, just give it a better auto. It's probably intended to make it bad for damage, and make you plan your gun switching so you start a fight with low gravitum so you won't switch to it.

Crescendum is honestly too good. It works well with every gun, when the turret ability is not as good (Severum/Infernum), the gun ability works well with Crescendum (duskwave on multiple targets for instant chakrams, severum's onslaught produces chakrams over its duration while providing movespeed, helping with kiting, the chakrams main strength). 

Calibrum is extremely good with Crescendum, useful with gravitum, and mediocre with the other 2. Rather than poke I would say this gun is for finishing opponents and it does well with that. 

Infernum  has good synergies with every gun, but its ability is low range and slow. In contrast, its ult is extremely good for poking the backline. In practice, I have found little to no opportunity to 5 man infernum ult as doing so is a little hard when enemies do not generally group together in a tight clump. 

So yeah, he's definitely overtuned with some guns, but don't make the mistake of saying his guns have no downsides. Jinx's guns have downsides, but their upsides are also much better.

Low Armor/MR/Health. His only ""escape"" is the movespeed from Severum and Gravitums Slow/Root, and depending on how quick you are or how slow the ADC is, you can easily kill him before he right clicks you or before he can root you. 

Speaking of Severum though, that weapon in particular appears to be a bit strong. Watching your Cait lose a 1v1 where she's a BF and dagger over him because of Severum Q is kinda depressing. Maybe the weapon itself needs to heal less, or maybe it shouldn't attack with Severum as much as it does.

Whenever I play the champ I feel like it's necessary to try to hold on to Severum, Gravitum and Infernum for as long as I can for fighting. I try not to use them for farming waves if I can. Now that may just be me not playing the champ enough or maybe it's the mindset that everyone has whenever they play the champ. 

So I feel like there's some form of weapon management, maybe it's not as extreme as people thought it was or hoped for but it's there. Maybe I'm overthinking it, maybe I can just walk around, take any fight with any weapon and win the game but when I look at it, the 3 weapons I mentioned cover everything an ADC is supposed to do, or cover everything you want in an ADC. A form of escape or good dueling/healing with Severum/Gravitum, you get a slow/root with Gravitum, and with Infernum you get a good amount of damage so logically you would want to keep those weapons at a usable amount for fighting and/or set them on a priority list and cycle through to get a refill. In lane, I won't use Severum until after I've used Calibrum, then when Gravitum comes in, I'll switch to Severum because I think Gravitum is more important to keep in general, but I guess it's very dependent on whats going on in lane as well. 

Anyway, I think Severum and like you mentioned, Crescendum should be looked at by Riot. 

To address the main point of your post, I think he gets punished quite a bit whenever he doesn't have his escape tools and that's not just by assassins. He can't take 1v1's against other ADC's or whoever if he doesn't have Severum and/or Crescendum unless he's considerably ahead of whoever he's trying to fight, and he's not guaranteed to have those 100 percent of the time, he can only have one of those all the time if he decides to just keep it from the 1st time he gets it and never uses it.

This is why ADCs did not have this level of utility in the early days of League. The best utility in the past was Ashe or Sivir. Everyone else had lots that focused purely on damage.


I’ll say it once and I’ll say it again, trying to push the limits on these champions IS fun and interesting. BUT, it is terrible for Leagues long term health. The game simply does not work with champions that can excel at so many things. 


Good champions have clear strengths and glaring weaknesses that provide clarity for the player and opponent. 

Darius for example is straight forward. Get 5 stacks. That’s his goal. Land the blade of the Q. Short range, has to run at you. Long cool down short range pull. GLARING weakness, clear avenues to win though. 

Compare kog maw and aphelios. Kog maw basically is a monster with his W up, and weak without it. Aphelios doesn’t have that. Sure gravitum is bad for dueling, but he’s just as threatening. The threat of CC is sometimes more threatening than damage. 

More importantly is that champions usually have a key ability in the past that once it’s used, that’s your window to outplay. Lucian dashes? That’s your window. Vayne condemned? That’s your window. Aphelios just doesn’t care about that. He poops a turret down and stands near it if he has to or walks away until he can put another one down. If he uses the CC he can follow up or disengage. 

There is just no real clarity with Aphelios and most new champions. They just give the new champions an answer for every scenario and it’s not healthy",0.9836,21.7,65.10000000000001,21.7

If anyone has played D&D, a DM I played with made up this original enemy of his which only had 25 HP, but every time you hurt it, it would heal itself with it's reaction ability to 5 less HP than it had before. So if it had 25 HP and you hit it down to 17 HP, it'd instantly heal back up to 20 HP. You couldn't counter it in anyway, and it always worked. The DM was so proud of this healing mechanic that he created, but in the end you'd get the same experience out of just making an enemy with like 75 HP.

Skill ceiling is debateable where that lands [Although marksmen can have high ceilings]

Also did anyone really expect Aphelios to be anything *except* an aberration when it was announced he was made by CertainlyT? On top of his general track record; his prior ADC projects have been Kalista and the Graves rework [And the very small minor Caitlyn ""rework"" that was so tiny it hardly counts, and that was busted for a good while too]. Look how well those both turned out. Kalista basically had to be dumpstered and Graves was a complete failure at what it was actually supposed to do and ended up a jungler.

The only good thing about Aphelios is it's confirmed to be CertainlyT's last champ design project now he's been moved to TFT. Unfortunetly it's his final and perhaps biggest FU to the balance team. How on earth are the balance team supposed to balance a champion with 5 styles of autoattack; 20 different Q combinations [5 Q's each with 4 potential secondary effects] which can reset into each other; and 5 potential R's? Such a task is nigh impossible.

I actually feel sorry for the poor guys who have to try and fix this mess, and honestly the best way to deal with it might be to legitimately give him the Twitch/Evelynn treatment of 'dumpster intentionally until rework' because as it stands; his design is going to be nigh-on impossible to actually balance [And that's ignoreing internal balance between his weapons so they all are useful and feel OK to use...]",0.7339,10.0,81.69999999999999,10.0

In my experience people would rather play against sett then aphelios just because of the anti fun kit aphelios has. He is fun if you play him but i don't think the designer and riot really thought out how it would be to play against him. To even back up my opinion: CertainlyT is the designer of this champion. He also designed yasuo and Zoe and guess what? They have the same kind of anti fun kit aphelios has.

An enemy like that, if the players understand how the mechanic works, encourages the party to think about how they sequence their attacks. Maybe the big Barbarian shouldn't blow his load, only to have his attack mostly negated. You use a weak attack to blow the healing and then a big attack to do damage. I *like* these sorts of designs, done sparingly and correctly, because getting players to actually use their brains in combat can be an uphill battle. 

But that's assuming the party has the time and interest to discover these things. And assuming the DM is using reactions properly (one per round). And assuming the initiative order is correct.

Aphelios is the same problem, that the designers are assuming the other player has the reaction time, interest, and ability to track his guns and ammo like they would track major cool downs or mana on a mage.

Of every single new champ since kaisa, I can't easily think of a scenario where the champs are significantly weak. All of these new reworks and champs are designed with big high skill plays in mind without a thought for how to really make the champ require high skill defensively too. Akali might require decent practice to efficiently utilize her kit but only offensively. Her shroud E and R all give so much leeway to kite out of mistakes that the player only really has to focus on doing damage as most champs cant reliably counter her playstyle.

For example, Calibrum is like light green, but Crescendum is white, and it's easy to mistake the two. Gravitum is purple, but Infernum is dark blue, so again it's easy to mistake the two. The only solutions I can suggest would be to change the colors (like, Infernum could be yellow or something, Calibrum a different (neon??) green), or add the weapon icon somewhere on the ult projectile (since it's a crescent, it can go in the concave part at the back).

Aphelios has an icon next to his health bar for his current main-hand weapon, so there is some clarity there. The only issue is that his off-hand weapon is hidden. This is arguably okay, since you can't expect a champion to give away everything to the enemy (e.g. it's like not knowing enemy champ's cooldowns, but you know what spells they possibly have), but some Q effects should definitely get extra indicators. For example, the turret could have an icon of what gun it's using to fire. If you can see Aphelios' model, I think the two guns he has does show on him (the off-hand is on his back or something), but that's just way too had to see and react to in an actual game.",-0.9467,9.6,74.7,9.6

List goes from Overall passive, to weapon passive, to Q’s, to W, and ending with Ults. I can answer most questions, but not ones regarding how to stack chakarums, long post warning.

 He passive is The hitman and the seer. He rotates through 5 weapons every 50 autos or 5 Q’s. Used weapons will move to the back of the rotation.The default rotation is Calibrum, Serverum, Gravitum, Infernum, and Crecendum. You can change the rotation based on what you run out of first. Cailbrum is long ranged, serverum is life steal, gravitum is a slow, Infernum is Aoe, and crecendum attacks faster at close range.

Each weapon has a unique passive. Calibrum’s autos will mark an enemy champion which can be consumed by auto attacking them. Severum’s autos heal per auto attack and will grant a small overhead shield. Gravitum’s autos slow and mark an enemy champion. The mark is used for its Q. Infernum’s autos deal 110% physical damage and will splash 4 bolts in a small come behind the target. Crecendum’s is if Aphelios uses an ability where he would need to throw creseidum, he will instead throw a tiny version of it that stacks up to 20.

Each weapon uses 10 ammo for Q. You can use the off-hands Q while the main hand’s Q is on cool down.  Calibrums Q is a mark that you can consume by auto attacking. Serverum’s Q is an automatic fast paced switch between your man hand and off hand weapons. This will lock auto attacks while the spell is active. Gravitum’s Q is a one second root that will do damage. This can only be activated when gravitum’s mark is on an enemy. Infernum Q is a splash of Aoe in a small cone shape. Crecendum Q places a turret of your off hand weapon that also will place the offhand’s passive on an enemy when hit.

W just swaps between the main and off hand weapons.

Each weapon has a different ult passive. Calibrums marks all champions hit and will do bonus damage when consumed. Serverum will heal him for 200/300/400 health of an enemy is hit. Gravidum slows for 99% for a bit. Infernum’s splash will attack in a circle around that champ instead of a cone dealing 75% of the ult damage. You can take overlapping splash damage ( Do NOT group when he has this ult. It’s the strongest one and will do a buttload of damage before you can move.) Cercendum’s will just spawn 3 extra chakarums.

I would argue he may even be just objectively the worst.

First, Aphelios's design fails because the supposedly complex kit doesn't actually demand a lot from the player at it's core. The central reason as to why is that each weapon's ability has extremely limited interaction with the abilities of other weapon's. We are given the illusion of a deeply connected kit since three out of five of his Q abilities result in an auto attack from the off hand weapon. However, thinking purely about following up one weapon's ability with another ability, there's not any sort of direct synergy. If you use chakram q and follow it up with flamethrower q you've simply used two abilities that are strong on their own, and are generally just extra damage and auto attacks. The extent of making proper usage of the abilities is whether or not the enemy is in range of the flamethrower and putting the turret down in a spot that maximizes its attacks. The most in depth ability is his ult, where the player simply has to make the decision between two options.

Secondly, the ult itself is very confusing to other players, since you need to know what weapon he is currently holding to determine it's impact.

Finally, he just doesn't feel great to play as or against. When you play him you don't feel that you're actually being demanded to think creatively, you're simply pressing q on your current weapon and playing to it's strength. Against him he just barfs up a huge array of different auto attack animations based on each weapon, and was way overturned coming out of the gates (and seems to still be too strong).",-0.5514,13.4,73.0,13.4

Alune can be launched as an ADC along with Aphelios, give each of them 2 of the guns, maybe a 3rd in common.

This way it would be less convoluted and still be interesting. They could be a duo bot like Rakan & Xayah, Lucian & Senna being Alune & Aphelios.

Don't even need to change the VO all that much if at all, just let them keep a mental connection with Alune being chatty. Hah!

And just get rid of the current ultimate, in favor of a more static but  more unique one, instead of big ball of damage. Even if it still applies  the weapon effects, having a less weapons would make it more  predictable.

Getting rid of the ammo mechanic would not be a big loss either in case of each kit having  only 2 weapons.  Could even give each of them an E skill, and complementing new Rs.

Think about the last 4 character releases. The only one that is even a little simple is Sett, and as far as bruisers go, it still has a few complexities.

But Aphelios? 5 guns, 20 combination-effects. Mark this, tons of damage that, stunned there, slowed there, shot from 1000 meters, Ult that one shots, Ult that slows. No visibility on secondary gun, the list goes on.

Senna? Infinite stacking Passive, huge range-aoe healing damage poke, AoE invisibility for allies that also gives movement speed, builds assassin, has a long range huge hitbox control-activation Root that also slows you on hit, global ult that shields in a wide area, and damages in a thin one.

Qiyana? Low cooldowns, spammable gapclose/dodge, 9 different ability effects, engage that makes her main damaging ability literally undodgeable, high AD ratios, high scalings, an Ult that knocks you back, and then stuns you along the whole wall, meaning she could totally miss it and most people will still end up dead by it.

It would still be a unique number of “transformations“ for LoL with bonus ammo management, and you would feel the pinch of whichever gun you’re missing if each has a unique niche.

IMO they need to get rid of Infernum and Crescendum. Crescendum deserves its own champion, and Infernum is just a balance nightmare, especially the ult. More than that, their unique damage patterns make it unnecessarily complicated and nightmarish for opponents to play around. Calibrum for range/safety, Severum for healing/dueling and Gravitum for cc. Even if you can’t see his off-hand then, well there’s only 2 possibilities.

My idea: Q is his current Q, W is for gun swapping and E is his Crescendum Q (Sentry), which would deploy your third gun and indirectly allow you to have all 3 in play at once. Add a range limit to AAing marked targets and maybe make his ult consistent (not change effects based on main hand)... and bam, easier to balance champion.",0.9664,19.0,71.6,19.0

It would make more sense if you were capable of learning how to play against a champ’s kit, even if it is overloaded, like Akali, Qiyana, and others. In that case, you are at least able to see and understand what they are doing. 

But with Aphelios, it’s physically straining and brutal to figure out what’s happening. You’re able to understand what each gun does and what they do, but since there’s so many combinations and there’s no figure to see what the offhand is, the only way to figure it out are with colors. That’s not healthy in the slightest. 

On top of this, each gun is very overloaded and has crazy mechanics unlike any other in the game. There’s no downside for having whichever gun in a fight.  I appreciate the effort to make a “unique” champion, but it’s simply not good for the game with the state he’s in right now.

To add to my 3 guns point, I feel like one of his most important mechanics, ammo management, is a sham because so many of his guns are interchangeable. Calibrum/Infernum/Crescendum all have the same agenda (DPS) simply with different trading patterns. To have truly made ammo management important, Aphelios needs to feel the pinch of not having a gun available, and that can only happen if each gun is a truly unique niche.

Fair enough, I'll try to help you as much as possible in couple of sentences. So, basically riven is allowed to sneak autoattacks between every ability or partial ability (the tripple Q) she uses, thus, if she manages to land a full combo on someone by a person whom hands are fast enough and learned how to sneak the autos (aka the animation canceling), she gets plenty of extra unavoidable damage which no other champion is allowed to do. Imagine an Aatrox who can fast autoattack after each Q, but because of that his next Q comes even faster, because the autoattack canceled the animation of between the two Qs, but also the next Q is allowing his next autoattack to come faster as well because it cancelled the previous autoattack animation, but not the effect and so on and so on or imagine a Garen who can autoattack between every spin of his E, but the autoattack also makes next E spin comes faster which makes his next autoattack  comes faster etc. Well this is what a fast handed Riven players do and this is what Riven as a champion is allowed to have because... reasons :)",0.9577,12.6,84.1,12.6

But most of the time you're gonna use one of several combos that have been chosen for you that have fairly simple interactions with each other and allow you access to a fairly simple ult. It's all very complicated because you have to learn what all of these different combos and ults do by heart and makes him an ungodly nuisance to play against because you have to go to the wiki and study his whole kit a bunch just to do so which is honestly kinda offensive, but there's not a whole lot of depth beyond that.

Although I still think this is blown out of proportion.

This post in particular complains about the clarity of the ult but really it’s quite straightforward that when aphelios has his purple gun he can root you with his ult. Personally I don’t think that ignorance of a kit’s capability can be excused by design flaws but if riot says it can then then they’re right.

If people spent the same time learning apehlios’s kit as they do complaining about it they probably wouldn’t have as many complaints. OP doesn’t even spell his name right so why would we assume they’ve taken any necessary measure to learn his kit?

Firstly it's pretty clear he switched to gravitum before ulting, secondly there's a pretty clear purple hue to the ult (although I do agree this could benefit from being slightly more defined).

Regardless, his offhand shows gravitum, so people should be prepared for an ult that's going to root them. 

If he ults out of fog it's a completely different story. If it was clear that the ult was gravitum, do you really think people would be able to see the ult just before it hits them, process which type of ult it is, and then react accordingly? Maybe. But again it has a hue to it (which could be more clear but is clearer than most people on this sub admit).

I'm more concerned with the fact that most of these aphelios-whining posts are really just lazy people who don't spend the time learning a new champs kit and have to learn the hard way.

You want me to mention Senna's Passive ? Are you sure ? 

Absolution	
INNATE - WEAKENED SOUL: Senna's basic attacks and abilities on enemy champions apply Mist for 4 seconds. Senna's next attack collects the Mist and deals 1% − 16% (based on level) of target's current health Attack damage bonus physical damage. The same target cannot be collected more than once every few seconds.

Enemy Champion large minions and large monsters that die near Senna spawn a Mist Wraith for 8 seconds. Epic monsters spawn 2 Mist Wraiths instead. Minions and lesser monsters have a 20% chance to spawn Mist Wraiths, reduced to 1.67% chance on those that Senna kills. Senna can basic attack a Mist Wraith to destroy it, gaining Gold 3 and collecting its Mist.

ABSOLUTION: Each stack of Mist grants Senna 1 bonus attack damage. For every 20 stacks, Senna also gains  25 bonus range and 15% critical strike chance. Upon exceeding 100% critical strike chance, Senna converts 35% of the excess into Life steal .

Absolution 2	
RELIC CANNON: Senna basic attacks deal 20% AD bonus physical damage on-hit and grant 10 / 15 / 20% of the target's movement speed as Movement speed for 0.5 seconds on-hit.

And Here is Malphite Passive that you Described :
SHARD OF THE MONOLITH: Malphite's size scales with his maximum armor (before applying Thunderclap Thunderclap's bonus armor), capped at around 850 maximum armor.

That 1s root on Gravitum can be a death sentence. No, flashes allowed. It can allow for some sudden deaths alongside Aphs team.

Infernum Q helps wave clear fast. Even early game. Though I agree it's not reliably applied in team fights but not using Q means you have more ammo for AoE ranged autos.

That said, I roughly agree with your order. Just want to point out that even the ""least"" of his Qs is really strong with current tuning.

On the ult. His ult has good base so the specific augment it gets doesn't take away from that. Cresendum R is likely the weakest single interaction/mechanic in the entire kit. Gravitum R isn't that bad as its a 99% slow (does it decay to 10% after 0.7 seconds? Or a different value?) and lets you then get the root to prevent flashes. Though again I comment for the same reason as before.

Severum ult is a good example of how weirdly deep Aph is. It gives Aph a base heal that doesn't scale with targets. However, the basic R makes you auto everyone hit by R with your main hand weapon...which applies Severum's ""passive"" self healing. So the actual amount of healing Aph gets is a pretty wide spread of results.

But yeah everythings an essay and we're not *really* digging into the math. It works out the math is crazy because it's all scaling off autoattacking. So it gets super multiplicative.",0.9796,17.299999999999997,75.5,17.299999999999997

Purple ball gun: gravity gun, Gravitum. Applies a decaying slow on hit. If you use Q while they’re being slowed, they get rooted.  
Fidget spinner gun: chakrams, Crescendum. Throws chakram which returns to him. Aphelios is disarmed until it’s returned. Activating it (Q) puts down a turret which fires his offhand, applying all of the off-hands effects.

That said I ran into a game the other day where High Noon Ashe and Dawnblade Riven were on the same team.  I bring this example up because High Noon Ashe uses a similar rig to  Championship Ashe.  So she has some flowing bits off her arms and shoulders that turns white either when she activates q or has it stacked.  The killer was that her run animation is the Project Ashe one so I legit saw a woman with flowing white robes and big something held behind them.  At a glance I reacted like its riven.  A longer look quickly showed it was ashe but sometimes you react to glances.

And to be honest I don't really care because it's such a narrow use case that I don't want it to remove those awesome skins.",0.714,9.3,83.3,9.3

Personally I still think that a champ that generates such insane pick pressure just by existing is a bit stupid but eh.

Kalista is a failure period, Riot has no idea how to make that champ playable in solo queue without taking over competitive. Her pickrate is sub 1% and her winrate is around 48-49%, which is incredibly low for a high skillcap AD carry.

Now

> Darius

The current Darius rework isn't his, he had to be reworked because instant Q was incredibly oppressive.

> Zyra

Same as Darius, though to be fair she isn't much different now from the old one.

> Thresh

Sure, had to be trimmed heavily.

> Yasuo

Same as Thresh. Also one of the most hated champions in the game.

> Graves

He's a tad like Kalista, where if he's good he kind of takes over the jungle, but not as extreme. Still a pretty problematic champ.

> Warwick

He was heavily leashed during this rework, but yeah it's pretty good imo.

> Caitlyn

She was completely oppresive until they got the headshot hurricane interaction that he insisted on keeping. Now it's fine.

So it's much more of a mixed bag than people pretend it to be. I think he's a good designer but only in the sense that he usually thinks up a decent kit then has someone else clean up the mess and trim unneeded stuff. But he's had far more blunders than people like to admit.

Jury's arguably out on Aphelios but I'm leaning towards failure at all. He has a complex kit with a simple playstyle, which is the worst combination.",0.4628,16.7,66.5,16.7

I think it should be immediately obvious what the damage will be. The grenade will become a complete zoning tool if he has the power to make it full power whenever just because he holds W to finish off the caster line.",-0.898,4.1000000000000005,83.5,4.1000000000000005

I mean you could just play the champ really well. There are assloads of champions that don't have a little tick like this, it's preposterous to say that the people that main those champs are less than people that main other champs. You don't need to have flash to have substance and you shouldnt play the game around how you perceive others perceiving your gameplay.

I don't buy that idea at all, it's neat but it's far from a mad style play or something that's difficult, the trick is knowing that this mechanic exists CONTRARY  to the tooltip, that's not a good way to do that.

All that being said they can just as easily change the tooltip as fix the bug, Jhin isn't exactly a problem child atm.

My first an least compelling argument is that not everyone reads tooltips since some of them, not just this one, are either misleading, unclear, or outdated. I, for example, instead look at recent guides if I want to learn about a champion's abilities. (This does not mean that the tooltip shouldn't be updated, it should! It just means that many players do not rely on the tooltips to learn about a champion's abilities, but instead rely on their experience or third-parties, which is why I don't believe that the skill required to pull off Q-auto is not primarily about knowing that the tooltip being wrong.)

Even if the tooltip was changed to something like ""Bouncing Grenade deals bonus damage every time a target dies before the subsequent target is hit"", the majority of non-mains would not use this mechanic. It takes a few games to know when your Q is going to deal enough damage so that the minion will only be one auto away from death thus allowing this Q+auto combo to be done. It takes a bit of practice, and someone who only plays the champ once in a while won't always think of doing it even if it is mentioned in the tooltip. Ahri Q gives bonus movespeed according to tooltip, but non-mains will very rarely use Q for the movespeed, while mains will use it if the situation calls for it. 

Even if the tooltip is changed (which it should be), there are still opposing players which are not going to expect the bonus damage from a bouncing grenade that isn't going to kill the casters on its own, the same way that some players don't always predict that a minion will be bursted by the carry when a Blitz throws his Q at a half hp minion standing in front of that player.

I think you misunderstood my point about differentiating mains from casuals. It's not about wanting to look good to others, it's about feeling like I'm good. Even if it's not the flashiest thing in the world, it's FUN and makes me feel like I'm good at my champion. Even if I'm not actually that good, isn't having fun the whole point? Pulling off a flashy mechanic that not everyone uses feels good, no matter the champion. It feels good to flash over the big ass toplane wall then see the champion chasing you fail miserably. It feels good to pull off the shy Riven combo, knowing that not everyone can do it. It feels good to start to channel R right before a stun or a knockup as Ezreal to maximize your DPS. Hell, it felt good to quickscope people back when I played CoD with my friends on Xbox Live. I'm not a streamer or a pro player, no one is ever going to watch me land some mildly cool lvl 3 poke in botlane. It's not about how I look to other people, it's about me and the other Jhin mains out there who enjoy doing it.

As you said, I don't think Jhin is problematic right now, and this bug/mechanic has never been something people saw as unfair, despite it being well-known. I don't believe for one second that Riot never knew about this, this is a very well-known combo on Jhin that most mains either figured out on their own, or heard about through guides, streams or talking to other mains in communities such as /r/JhinMains . It feels weird to have it taken away without a mention, which is why we believe it is an accident and should be reversed, since it was a fun part of the game for us Jhin Mains (and the tooltip should be updated).",0.9836,15.6,72.7,15.6

It's not missing if it's done on purpose.

The fact is that this is a well-known interaction that no one has ever complained about, and while it is not the flashiest thing, it's one of the very few ways Jhin mains can outplay their opponents who don't expect you to use Q BEFORE autoing the minion, yet still have the extra burst, because you knew that your Q would make the minion have low enough HP to be killed of by a single auto before the grenade hits the champion.

This may come as a surprise to someone I assume to be an Akali main, but you don't need 10 dashes and invisibility to be able to express skill.

She will throw Q and then E, and land with E before Q lands and retroactively refresh her E. This happens on both living and dead targets as far as I was able to confirm on practice tool. In fact this goes further and if she Q>E's quick enough, later targets hit by the Q still gain moonlight even though E is supposed to eat Moonlight stacks. This is even more drastic than just a grace period mechanic. She is rewarded with a whole extra reset just by being quick fingered.

 * Kalista E has a grace period on her rend where auto's and Q's in flight will be used to Rend even if Kalista casts E before those spears have hit their target. The damage becomes much burstier when she doesn't have to delay her E until these spears land. Retroactively applies more damage.
 * Ezreal passive has a slight grace period where his passive stacks will refresh to maximum value if they drop right as his spell hits. Sounds like a small deal but his passive is like 50% attack speed. A huge bonus throughout the entire game. Retroactively refreshes a buff that was supposed to have dropped.
 * Rengar's Grace Period is listed but he is able to jump after leaving brush. How is that fair for you as the enemy? You played the range right but based on his movespeed he can jump on you anyway.
 * Darius R exists with a grace period too. Is it fair that if he fails to kill the target with R he gets the reset just because they died in 0.25 seconds?

I was writing up a list of champions with similar mechanics before this and testing them because I was genuinely curious. There are plenty of champions with grace periods.

You are looking at this from a perspective of the enemy, but it turns out that it's more important for spells to feel impactful for the player using them and not about how it feels for the enemy (Riot has confirmed this is core to their design theory before and is why Lollypopping is prevalent on skillshots, especially hooks). Jhin's ability to buffer the damage on his Q using the grace period (maybe it could be argued to be a bit strong, but Jhin isn't even broken to begin with and removing this mechanic will drastically hurt Jhin mains) isn't some out there super absurd thing.

Why is it important to shadow nerf a very important mechanic for Jhin players when he's a 50% winrate champ? Even if he was 53-54%, why would we remove this rather simple mechanic instead of directly nerfing whatever numbers are making him OP to begin with?

It's not like the Q bounce has champion prioritization either.

Contrary to what a lot of people think, under most circumstances Nami is pretty bad at initiating on her own, unless she’s comboing as a secondary initiator, her ult will probably do very little. It’s why when you actually do land it, the slow is pretty nasty.  
There is an argument that Nami should never actually be good at initiating since Nami’s thing is doing everything and being the most versatile support, but not excelling in any particular area.  
But either way as it stands, her ult is to disengage, make her bubble much easier to land on a diver, or to follow up on someone else’s engage.

The reason taric is best for all this, is inherent synergy with yi, and the value of his ult late game despite having no items.

Most supports have value without gold, but it's too easy for Yi to get ahead by funneling and taric Yi synergy is one if the best in the game.

Do you remember back in the day the revive summoner spell? Yea, that one that no one used and got removed.

Turns out that they were just summoning that spell to revive people regularly. When you died and the timer for your respawn started, it was a timer for the revive summoner spell to trigger.

They fixed that for some reason unknown to me. Maybe it was getting bugged, maybe exploited by hacks... I remember crazy hacks back in the day when they introduced the revamped mastery tree, but they didn't last long thankfully.

My guess is that the piece of code was still there. And they saw it while doing the practice tool and they just reutilised it. Later, it got deleted because supposedly it isn't in the game anymore, but it actually was, so what we got is a non functioning revive button in the practise tool.",-0.6636,8.1,81.8,8.1
