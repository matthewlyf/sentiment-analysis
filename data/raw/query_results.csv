According to who? Biofrost was Top 3 on TSM, Biofrost was Top 3 on CLG, Biofrost has been playing very well since his return. I dont really see that as outperforming but if youre trying to fit a narrative i guess it works.

That is the only one on your list where i agree, Mithy played alot better post TSM than he did on TSM, but tbf on OG he didnt have to teach his jungler how to play the game while playing support himself.

Lmao excuse me? How did Turtle NOT peak in TSM? You unironically think he has been better on FLY or IMT than he was in  2014 for TSM? You started watching league 2 years ago i guess?

Similiary, Santorin was REALLY good in Spring 2015 and actually helped TSM to an international tournament win. He fell off a cliff in Summer 2015 and stayed that way for quite a while, one can argue that hes better now than he was back then but even here i wouldnt say its obvious by any means.

As for what people praise about him it only takes listening to Parth or Loco talk about him in one of the many long-form interviews/shows to get a sense of how superficially he's the PERFECT player. The perfect teammate. Everything a coach could ask for. Yet every other player TSM places around him always crumbles and can't perform.

This is not unrelated. The fandom or staff's belief that Bjergsen can do no wrong is not random trivia. It contributes to the workplace environment whether intentional or not.

Bjergsen is the consistent performer on TSM. Everyone else underperforms.

Even TSM fans now say something is wrong with TSM as an org instead of putting Bjergsen through more scrutiny.

Now instead of reconsidering their mid position, they offer Bjergsen unprecedented pro player career stability in partial team ownership. People think the Huni contract is overkill? Even Faker would never get Bjergsen's level of special treatment by his org: he had to share the stage with another mid remember?

TSM is gonna get worse before it gets better. This will exacerbate the problem, not solve it. Dardoch thought Loco gave Piglet special treatment on TL... Boy he's in for a ride with TSM now.

Bjergsen is inscrutable within TSM and that didn't happen by accident. If he was really hungry for the win/recognition as a pro player on the world stage he would've voluntarily switched teams or even tried going back to EU to prove himself.

178,1447,0.04273676872253418,"Sneaky will and always will be one of the greatest ADCs NA produced but in recent years I do believe Sneaky has not been performing to the standards or expectations from what is expected of a good ad carry. For example, during 2019 Spring Sneaky had 8.9 CSM and 8.5 during the Summer. In comparison, Zven had 9.5 CSM at Spring with 9.1 CSM at Summer.  (Doublelift had highest CSM at 10.3 during Spring, Cody Sun had highest CSM at 9.5 during Summer)

No offense to Sneaky, but his stats are what I will expect from a player in a low-tier team and even if these stats difference may be small, it will be substantial against top-tier teams.                                                                                                                                                                         If we want to compare CSD@15, Sneaky had an average of -6 CSD@15 while Zven had +2 CSD@15 during Spring. During Summer, Sneaky had an average of -6 CSD@15 while Zven had -7 [CSD@15](mailto:CSD@15).

Shouldn't it be obvious which player should receive higher expectations on their level of performance in pro play? Even in recent times, there are memes about ""Sneaky in lane,"" popularized by Doublelift in 2016 who said Sneaky is trash in lane (but good in teamfights) and to some extent there is some truth in what Doublelift says.

There may be a bit of recency bias here, but I do believe Zven will be a better mechanical player and most consistent than Sneaky, because Zven has always been regarded as a top tier adc (during his G2 and Origen years) by many pros which tells you something about his mechanical prowess while also showing an insane work ethic. In S9, Zven has played around 1806 games in NA solo que ([https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9%20Zven](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9%20Zven)) while Sneaky has played around 1262 games ([https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+Sneaky](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+Sneaky) including his smurf C9 Gun). During S9, Zven has around 1439 games played in S9 while Sneaky has around 1200 games. Also these are just the amount of Solo q games he has played in NA. Zven also has a EUW account ([https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+ZV3N](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+ZV3N)) where he played around 403 games in S8 and around 270 games in S9. Even if C9 does poorly in some games, I don't think it will stop them from being a potentially top 3 team (most likely top 2 as they always had in the past) in NA as they have such a strong showing in the first two weeks with good chemistry and macro play and I believe that Zven will perform consistently well in his future games at C9.
