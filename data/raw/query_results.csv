WildTurtle is a bit of an oddball, because i thought he always had the right playstyle for TSM but he wasn't an amazing player, also Turtle is from NA, this thing seems to be more true for non-NA players. Amazing and Zven both had the best year after leaving TSM. For Santorin it is a bit different, since he wasn't actually on a real team after leaving TSM so he wasted that bonus basically.

And the reason why Zven was bad is obviously TSM. They never play to their superstars. If you get that super botlane from EU you have to play the style they want. You can't play your usual Bjergsen does something and maybe we win style.

That is the only one on your list where i agree, Mithy played alot better post TSM than he did on TSM, but tbf on OG he didnt have to teach his jungler how to play the game while playing support himself.


> Santorin, Wildturtle, Amazing and the former mentioned all have better seasons in other team

Lmao excuse me? How did Turtle NOT peak in TSM? You unironically think he has been better on FLY or IMT than he was in  2014 for TSM? You started watching league 2 years ago i guess?

Similiary, Santorin was REALLY good in Spring 2015 and actually helped TSM to an international tournament win. He fell off a cliff in Summer 2015 and stayed that way for quite a while, one can argue that hes better now than he was back then but even here i wouldnt say its obvious by any means.

And Amazing only played a single split for TSM before he got homesick and he did pretty fine in that split considering the circumstances, yea he arguably played better in 2015 but his Team was also better."

Bjergsen was bullied BAD. It's well-documented and comes straight from himself: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=676609642362402&id=485525748137460&sfnsn=mo

As for what people praise about him it only takes listening to Parth or Loco talk about him in one of the many long-form interviews/shows to get a sense of how superficially he's the PERFECT player. The perfect teammate. Everything a coach could ask for. Yet every other player TSM places around him always crumbles and can't perform.

This is not unrelated. The fandom or staff's belief that Bjergsen can do no wrong is not random trivia. It contributes to the workplace environment whether intentional or not.

Bjergsen is the consistent performer on TSM. Everyone else underperforms.

Even TSM fans now say something is wrong with TSM as an org instead of putting Bjergsen through more scrutiny.

Now instead of reconsidering their mid position, they offer Bjergsen unprecedented pro player career stability in partial team ownership. People think the Huni contract is overkill? Even Faker would never get Bjergsen's level of special treatment by his org: he had to share the stage with another mid remember?

TSM is gonna get worse before it gets better. This will exacerbate the problem, not solve it. Dardoch thought Loco gave Piglet special treatment on TL... Boy he's in for a ride with TSM now.

Bjergsen is inscrutable within TSM and that didn't happen by accident. If he was really hungry for the win/recognition as a pro player on the world stage he would've voluntarily switched teams or even tried going back to EU to prove himself. He knows he'd be dumb to give up what he has at TSM. It's not loyalty. The chances of getting another org wrapped around a player's finger to this extent are slim to none."

I would blame TSM's management even more (not to say they have been doing something wrong with whatever the fuck happened to this team's playstyle after that spring split) if Zven didn't just play bad individually as well from his first season with them, watch the playoffs vs CG and just watch how he positions, watch the regular?/playoffs? games in the next split vs C9 (especially when he's on Varus WITH A TAHM KENCH) and he still goes melee range under C9 turret to auto it and brings C9 back in the game which begins the reverse sweep iirc.

I am glad he is doing good now and doesn't feel the same pressure as before, but chalking it up to a simple ""TSM dark arts forced him to be bad as an INDIVIDUAL"" is something a lot of people are doing now but it's not that simple.

And DL doesn't require resources, he gets them because his team-mates are always far more outclassed than he ever was.

It's the same reason why Rekkles also improved massively when he got a support that could match him in Hylisang."
166,1550,0.09166398644447327,"It's also easy to look bad when you're team is doing bad. Hence why Froggen wasn't doing well on several NA teams but he seems to be back in form on dignitas. 

Also, hence why Zven looked bad on TSM even though he was the main carry of several very successful EU teams. 

Not saying you're wrong to say what you're saying. I'm just saying it goes both ways."
167,1609,0.09081176668405533,Bjergsen is the ultimate gaslighter. He contributes so much to a negative team atmosphere and toxic work environment but everyone that worked with him praises superficial aspects of his work ethic. They judge everyone else by the metrics that Bjergsen is exemplary in and place 0 value on what other people bring to the table. His fragile ego and victim mentality are hard to overcome given his childhood experiences and it's baffling to see TSM all-in on this guy even harder when they've already tried everything except switch out the mid laner since 2014.
168,1932,0.08997556567192078,"Yes, and TSM bought Zven at the end of S7, when he was considered to be as good as Rekkles, but he was also bringing his support. In retrospect you can easily say that it was a bad move, but at the time it looked like a clear upgrade.  


And my point about the DL, Rekkles and Perkz wasn't to prove that he's not better than them, but that FNC and G2 needed a specific style, champ pool and consistency from their bot laners, and DL doesn't match them when it comes to that, hence the weak point (he's better than them at other stuff, but I struggle to think of an EU team that would put that to use)."
169,1551,0.08760136365890503,"Then you realise C9 as individuals aren't actually great.

Nisqy is a very average mid laner even in NA, same for Blabber as a jungler. Licorice is a good NA top laner but still not very good when you consider the rest of the world, Vulcan is probably their second best player after Zven.

The difference with C9 is they have a really good coach who seems to know how to get his points across and get the team playing basic macro really well for the whole game, something most NA teams can't do.


Zven had some notable errors on TSM but I put that down to him trying to carry too hard because he knew his team was useless."
170,1712,0.08543910831212997,"Honestly it is more true for non-american players. Amazing and Zven did well, Santorin actually wasn't on a team when he left. And I honestly think Yellowstar went there to retire, I honestly think he only came back to FNC because they begged him, they had an awful year in 2016. Since 2017 he is coaching the team Eika played on and this year he is playing again as a support, but I think more due to not having anybody else\^\^.

The bigger issues for TSM though are that the players they get are kinda random. The issue they have are either with Coaching or Bjergsen, because those are the only constants for the team. If you change top, jungle and botlane and your problems stay the same you have to look at the things that didn't change."
171,1951,0.08320008963346481,"Just you saying he mispositioned less negates every thing else and shows you don’t know. He has never ever gotten over his flaw of mispositioning. Adrian played nothing but healing and shielding supports that allowed him not to die when he was fighting from a position he should have never been in. Still to this day he has positioning errors just like he did on imt and before then too. 

And of course he had higher dpm. All immortals ever did was fight around the map constantly. Anyone would have a higher dpm on that team compared to previous seasons. 

I’m a huge turtle fan but you’re blowing shit out of your ass trying to say he became better after leaving tsm."
172,1952,0.08173190802335739,"Zven was never going to have the support issue, with Mithy next to him. Zven, by himself, had more consistent performances that had a slight edge, but he also had years of experience with Mithy, while DL did not. 

&#x200B;

Even if you look at Worlds 2018, you see Zven having much better stats than DL, despite the fact that he played in a much harder group.   


And the resource point wasn't directly aimed at DL on TSM, since he wasn't the sole carry back then, but that Zven did not require too many resources to do well into Uzi and Ruler (and to also achieve the highest DPM and DMG% at the tournament)."
173,1923,0.07916194945573807,"Zven was constantly playing weak side, left to his own devices, while Akaadian hard focused on Bjerg. Akaadian usually plays for mid lane, and I'm not saying it's wrong or anything, but for the amount of resources Bjerg was getting, he wasn't especially impressive, unlike Zven. TSM only by the end of spring actually started playing fast LoL consistently, before it'd be one fast, one slow game, all because Bjerg couldn't snowball his leads into wins. They still had the highest average game time of all the teams in the world, in spring 2019.

In other words, look at the context, when evaluating a player."
174,1702,0.07812944799661636,"This is incorrect. Zven and Mithy being a package deal is just an excuse for the kick, they talked about how DL taking time off had shaken their expectations of him and their trust on him, and you can see on TL, it's not impossible to find a support on par with him without having to swap the whole lane, it's just a big dumb decision that has been exposed as such.

Zven also talks how TSM didn't want to renew his contract and has given him a heads up. So that's getting kicked, bro. Also he didn't want to leave last year, you can check his video before spring finals, he said he had offers but he didn't want his time in NA to be a waste, he wanted to double down and show he can be at the top."
175,1817,0.07327862083911896,"Honestly, Zven wouldn't even be the only one. DL and Cody have similar moments. Flash into Victor? Jump into Cass? And all of those were deciding games. 

And a game like this in a 5 game series, where nothing is happening and your team slowly gets outscaled, it is terrible to play that. Just think about it, if you ever had your promos and you picked an early game champ and won, and you only need to win that game to get to promotion and then your team suddenly decides to do nothing with your lead. That was the position Zven was in. If Zven didn't get caught there the game would likely go on. But Kaisa, Vladimir and Skarner? TSM had no tools to deal with that.

In such a situation when a game slowly slips away players like that tend to go for a play, even a bad one. Not to mention that 35 or so minutes into a game 5 of a series you are also exhausted."
176,1704,0.07117316126823425,"Splyce had a strong early game, bad mid game and good late game.

Kobbe was never afraid to go ham if there was an opportunity, but Splyce often stalled in the mid game if they couldn't snowball and 2019 was heavily focused around early game snowball so they were not punished for their slow mid game as often.

TSM seems to be absurdly risk averse, like they only want to play perfect, even if they understand that they need to be willing to take on risk, it just doesn't translate. But Kobbe looks like someone who is willing to go ham, same with Dardoch and Brokenblade.

But this goes beyond any single player or person, it seems to be the expectations around improvement on both an individuel and team level is making them resistent to change.

That is at least how it looks from the outside."
177,1816,0.0660414844751358,"Honestly NA teams loved to play into that hype. Just look how some of them figured that TL might be a dark horse for worlds, at most they ended up as a limping donkey. People complained why Jensen isn't on any of the top20 lists and things like that.

Just before the C9 game someone from TL said that they don't view C9 as a threat.

I think one of the reasons why C9 is good is because they are really reflected, when they were asked about the other teams they didn't say they are far above anybody else they said that they might lose to DIG because they look really good. And of course some of it is trashtalk, but I honestly think many NA teams are really bad to realize what there position is. When I always hear that TL is far above anybody in NA I wonder why it never shows. They are usually only one game apart from the second team in the regular split, they also actually have a negative winrecord against C9 in summer (3:4) and they also had a really close final against TSM before."
178,1447,0.04273676872253418,"Sneaky will and always will be one of the greatest ADCs NA produced but in recent years I do believe Sneaky has not been performing to the standards or expectations from what is expected of a good ad carry. For example, during 2019 Spring Sneaky had 8.9 CSM and 8.5 during the Summer. In comparison, Zven had 9.5 CSM at Spring with 9.1 CSM at Summer.  (Doublelift had highest CSM at 10.3 during Spring, Cody Sun had highest CSM at 9.5 during Summer)

No offense to Sneaky, but his stats are what I will expect from a player in a low-tier team and even if these stats difference may be small, it will be substantial against top-tier teams.                                                                                                                                                                         If we want to compare CSD@15, Sneaky had an average of -6 CSD@15 while Zven had +2 CSD@15 during Spring. During Summer, Sneaky had an average of -6 CSD@15 while Zven had -7 [CSD@15](mailto:CSD@15). (Stats are at [gol.gg](https://gol.gg))                                                                                                                               However Sneaky was on Cloud 9 who reached 2nd place in Spring and Summer while Zven was on TSM who reached third and fourth place in Spring and Summer. Shouldn't it be obvious which player should receive higher expectations on their level of performance in pro play? Even in recent times, there are memes about ""Sneaky in lane,"" popularized by Doublelift in 2016 who said Sneaky is trash in lane (but good in teamfights) and to some extent there is some truth in what Doublelift says.

There may be a bit of recency bias here, but I do believe Zven will be a better mechanical player and most consistent than Sneaky, because Zven has always been regarded as a top tier adc (during his G2 and Origen years) by many pros which tells you something about his mechanical prowess while also showing an insane work ethic. In S9, Zven has played around 1806 games in NA solo que ([https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9%20Zven](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9%20Zven)) while Sneaky has played around 1262 games ([https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+Sneaky](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+Sneaky) including his smurf C9 Gun). During S9, Zven has around 1439 games played in S9 while Sneaky has around 1200 games. Also these are just the amount of Solo q games he has played in NA. Zven also has a EUW account ([https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+ZV3N](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+ZV3N)) where he played around 403 games in S8 and around 270 games in S9. Even if C9 does poorly in some games, I don't think it will stop them from being a potentially top 3 team (most likely top 2 as they always had in the past) in NA as they have such a strong showing in the first two weeks with good chemistry and macro play and I believe that Zven will perform consistently well in his future games at C9.

TLDR: Zven has always been a consistent and good mechanical ad carry even with his mishaps at TSM."
179,1448,0.04198158159852028,"The year is 202X. After a decade of trophy-less splits, Regi finally uses his ultimate move, a suicide attack of sorts. Bjergsen had demanded - no, begged him to reconsider. But in that forlorn TSM house, empty save for Regi and Bjerg, the former team owner just just put his hand on his son's shoulder, and with sad eyes said, ""fuck it, baylife"". He put a slip of paper into Bjergsen's hands, then walked out the door.

That was the last Bjergsen ever saw of Reginald.

That was then, this is now. Bjergsen checks and rechecks the address Regi had handed him - his last gift. He looks back up, takes a deep breath...

Bjergsen walks up the sidewalk and knocks on the door. It opens. Bjerg gasps. No matter how many times he's seen her, the woman's beauty always leaves him breathless.

""I've been expecting you"", Sneaky says, and Bjergsen enters the C9 house.

Sneaky leads Bjergsen through the hall, down a staircase, into the deep dark pits of the cellar. Their in the darkness are three chairs, and 2 men.

""Doublelift?"" Bjergsen is confused. ""But the curse...""

Doublelift raises his eyes to meet Bjergen's gaze. ""...if never winning the split again is the price I must pay, I will gladly take it."" Bjergsen nods in understanding. He was prepared to make the same sacrifice.

They both turn to the third man.

Reapered sits, a human face so clearly housing something more than human. His eyes are deep and void, a window into the mind full of forbidden draft technologies and butthole jokes in broken English. ""Are you ready?""

""Yes"", C9's new mid and bot say in unison.

""Then let us begin"".

NA's road to a World cup begins here."
