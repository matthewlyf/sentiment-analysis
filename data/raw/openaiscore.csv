2,0.0549261,"I'm really, sincerely grateful to y'all for the award. However, I feel that awards like this are biased toward Rioters like me, because communications is my whole job. Meanwhile, there are so many unrecognized Rioters who add huge amounts of value for players—many of whom just don't feel like they have a reason to talk online to players, even though they do a ton to help Riot and League of Legends succeed. 

**So I have an idea:** What if Riot hosts a Reddit AMA featuring ""The Rioters You've Never Heard Of."" People like Riot's on-campus coffee baristas, copyright lawyers, and digital security experts? We've got some people with really wild jobs. It's not just designers, artists, marketing people, and programmers out here. 

Would people be interested in something like that?"

I also feel like G2 winning favorite team was due to recency bias. Just feels weird having them be ""best of the decade"" when they have only really been popular for about 2 years with them being half hate/memed on before that...compare that to a team like SKT that has been a constant in the League science's highest level for 7 years and it's definitely recency bias in my opinion.

268,-0.17023219,"The Bot Lane reason for playing; 'I enjoy being the carry' really emphasises the single most problematic element of LoL game design. 

Bot laner is meant to be a role in the game, but somehow it's become the game. Juggernaughts and bruisers counter tanks. For some reason, ADC does too. Melee DPM are good at taking neutral objectives. ADCs can do it almost as fast and more safely. Split pushers are good at taking towers, but ADCs are the only ones able to crack a defended tower. Teamfight champs are good at teamfighting at the expense of other elements. ADCs are good at teamfighting while also being good at almost all other elements.

ADCs are just an incredibly broken role that needs reworking so other role players can be able to play their role, and the idea that 'I play bot  because I enjoy being the carry' is fundamentally problematic because every role, except maybe support, should be able to impactfully carry a game and most of the time, they can't because ADC is too good at too much. Just make ADC champs the tower and neutral objective taking necessity that they already are (you basically can't win the game without your ADC alive unless you're fed enough to dive) at the expense of their PvP damage please, Riot. We already have whole classes designed to be ' 'tank/squishy' busters' who are just standing in the shadow of champions like Lucian and Senna who are for some reason Dashy/CC loaded poke DPM assassins.

I am more inclined to believe that the data you see is an actual honest representation of the League of Legends subreddit (not to be confused with the actual League demographics).

Also, ranks have shifted since last season with the inclusion of two more ranks. It makes sense that while perhaps silver may have been more popular years ago, those silver players are now gold, and platinum players are now diamond etc.

540,0.0809431,"Support at the moment, and for some time now, isnt the same as it was before.

With Supports like Nautilus, Leona, Thresh, Pyke and other Tanky playmaking supports being the strongest/most popular in their role instead of more ""boring"" champs like Lulu or Janna, more people tend to switch their role or atleast their secondary role to support.

I for example switched from jungle/top to jungle/sup and occasionally also que sup/jungle. Same for some friends of mine.

I've also seen people, and also saw it myself, that get autofilled to top or midlane, but not support. Not so long ago people were complaining that they get autofilled to support too often."
541,-0.05830743,"As far as I can tell, all web forums and matchmaking services outside the game itself skew heavily towards supports.  Even during the height of the support drought in dynamic queue this seemed to be the case.

For those that don't remember, Dynamic Queue was Summoner's Rift, but with auto-fill turned off and people could queue up as exactly the champion they wanted in the position they wanted as long as they were willing to wait to find the remaining players willing to play with them.  If you wound up on a team with something you didn't agree with, (like Soraka jungle or an Eve player or something) you could instantly re-queue with no penalty and you'd only get a lower priority if you did it a few times.

During that time if you queued as a mid you might wait five minutes to find your first teammate, because too many people were trying to get mid compared to the other roles.  If however you queued for support you could literally be placed on a team of five players ready to go within 7 seconds.  And you could be rude to these people and tell them to change their champions because you knew that you could find 3 more teams inside 30 seconds and any one of them might agree to your demands.  ...but I digress...

Even during that time, when it was obvious to everyone that support was the least popular role in general, team building sites like LoLDuo (rip) and Discord lobbies of that type had a disproportionately high percentage of free agent supports looking for people to play with.

My hypothesis is that this skewing is partially accounted for by the role thematically attracting players who are more social to begin with and partially by the role pragmatically requiring team play.  When your whole shtick is starting the game as very powerful champions and investing that power into your teammates until your champions are very weak by themselves you kind of want to find teammates you believe are worth the investment.  Other roles, who build up their own personal power over the course of the game, are probably more content with the built-in matchmaking."

I can only speak for myself but I'd be in favour of bans if presented the choice. I'd probably point to the reasons presented why people play aram and pick out that 'it is relaxing' and the enjoyment of constant team fighting. 

After the amount of games I've played in the mode I'm bored of seeing heavily weighted teams of a specific type of champion and being able to pinch that pool (e.g. poke champions) a bit is something I'd welcome. 

Since the nature of the mode is random, sometimes you aren't given the tools to deal with a heavily weighted comp of one type of champion and bans kind of give you something in that regard. Essentially the concept is randomness within reason and you get to choose what reason that is."

Veigar is another one. You can also feel that his numbers have been toned down, but it's still pretty annoying that his cage blocks half the lane and then he gets to point and click, blow you up.

Senna is the new one that I absolutely hate playing against. If you don't have the right champions to just dive on her or poke back at her, like Xerath, she just stands a mile away and pokes you down while simultaneously healing herself + team.

The primary reason people like bans is to get rid of a few champs they don't like playing against. People don't seem to get that fun for them isn't the same as fun for others. You may not like playing against lux or veigar or fidd, but that may be someone's favorite champion, so why is their fun more valuable than other people's?

The people who play LoL AND browse Reddit might not be representative for all the people who play LoL because it arguable takes a certain amount of dedication for a videogame to spend time on related subreddits. Which is probably one of the reasons why the elo graph here shows much more Plat and Diamond players. I'm sure there are people who lied about their elo, but the average elo on Reddit is probably higher than the average elo of the entire playerbase in the first place, because a Diamond player is probably more likely to spend time here than a Bronze player.

The most fun ARAM games are when everyone has shitty bruisers that just brawl 24/7. Have fun with Brand and Lissandra every game!

URF was already unplayable and would lose it's appeal even with fans pretty quickly when you get fountain dove by Vladimir, Zilean, Kayle comps and each game is decided by who is the better Vladimir.

660,-0.3292371,"That's a perfectly fine sample size. Most people not familiar with statistics overestimate how large of a sample size you need by **a lot.** For an example, Gallup polls, which are used to draw (usually pretty accurate) conclusions about the entire population of the US (320m+ people), only use a sample size of 1000 or 1500. 

The only noteworthy things regarding the sample is that this survey should only be used to make conclusions about the average LoL player *who uses Reddit* and *is willing to fill out a survey.* These traits will skew the data obviously, so it can't be taken to be representative of the entire playerbase overall. For example, it heavily overrepresents English-speaking players, since it was posted on Reddit and the survey was, presumably, only available in English. It also likely skews skill-level upwards, since if you're involved enough in LoL to read a subreddit about it, you're probably better than the average player. You could even get interesting effects like support players being over-represented because support is a role naturally about helping others, so they're more likely to spend the time to take a survey and help someone gather data."
661,-0.6038924,"A sample of almost 4000 is sufficient. If reasons exist that make this sample not representative of the entire playerbase, its not to do with sample size, but rather because it has been sampled from  a specific group of players."

toxicity would be a lesser problem tho if people would just use the mute button. like seriously, you can make that harassement stop in a single click with 0 consequences. what would you do in real life if you were constantly harassed, what would you do in real life if somebody was even tryna beat you up? wouldnt you dream of having a simple button to press to avoid all of that immidiately? of course that would be great. so here in these competitive games, you do have exactly that, why not use it? its not like much useful is written there anyway. the majority of information comes from pings anyway which you can also mute if one is to abuse that"

Carry role's need to be able to follow a teamfight, they need instant reactions to zhonya's that Varus R, or perfect awareness of where an opponent is moving too, making them more ideal for the traditional hunter's fundamental skillset.

Supports need to juggle active items and extra buttons, they need to notice ""We don't have vision on Baron anymore, we need to check it."" or ""There's a loose honeyfruit, someone's been here recently."" So they are better suited for the gatherer's fundamental skillset."

Syndra's pushback + stun is annoying, but it's pretty narrow so someone will be able to get her. Plus, because she has to use two abilities to get the stun, you should have enough time after snowballing her to land a CC of your own.

Personally, I don't think there are any champions that are so overwhelmingly strong on the map that they *need* bans, but I would like bans anyway. If I had to list champs that I thought are closest to ""needing"" bans, I would go with Veigar, Sion, and Yi. Veigar for the massive stun zone and ezpz delete button R. Sion because his passive can cheese towers/inhibs. Yi if people figure out how to do him correctly; I learned from seeing someone do it years ago, but no one seems to catch on. AD/crit yi will look more dominant, but Titanic Tank Yi is a much more consistent winner. It's the only champ I've ever been able to claw back a 1v9 with, and I've done it two or three times. The biggest weakness of that build is its utter uselessness until 6, during which time your team may decide to initiate and die in bad fights while you can do nothing about it.

Now, what I would actually use bans for.... (Edit: Sett right now because he's overtuned/hasn't had his map changes put in yet). Veigar sure because he's annoying af, but someone else will probably hit that so I'll go with Vayne or Aurelion Sol tertiary. Aurelion Sol is easy; I haven't seen one do well on the map since like release month. When someone's basically dead weight, the game is going to be less fun, regardless of which side that weight is on. Similar for Vayne, but not always. Vayne both requires drastically different play on ARAM and is very matchup dependent. She'll usually have a hard time because her range is so bad, and most people simply fail to adapt and wind up free-feeding with her, but even at best she won't do amazingly against typical comps. Where she shines is against melee/tank heavy comps, which she will steamroll with her W late game, and she cannot be shut down early due to the constant inflow of exp/gold in ARAM. So for one reason or another, an ARAM with Vayne in it is unlikely to be much fun."

I remember when yummi released and I tried to lane with her. If my adc went afk for 3 to 4 min or didn't know how to play with yummi as a sup, the game was most likely a loss. 

But that doesn't happen in every game. On ranked games you and your adc are probably at the same level of skills. And if that's not the case, you can always focus on your teammates and do well by assisting them with ganks or by warding some key spots. I don't play normal SR so I don't know about that and on other modes it's easier cause you can chose on whom to put your focus.

The role as a whole has a lot of agency with few drawbacks. You can do lots of things (initiate fights, gank, heal etc) but you cannot be the carry. There are exceptions but I don't consider them as true supports, they are the second APC of the team.

Also, winning the lane =/= doing well in lane. You don't have to dominate your opponents. That's not a healthy mentality to have if you want to ""progress"" in the game.

I find that very hard to believe. First of all, Gold 4 0LP at the end of the season is already below the 50th percentile which means the median LoL player is already _at least_ Gold.

Secondly, commitment may not be enough to make a player good but it surely is one of the requirements. You definitely can't be good at something without actually trying even a little bit.

However in the duo lane especially in soloq you might think something is a great play however your partner might be focused on something else. I’m also not saying this is the adcs fault I myself have been caught daydreaming while my adc was trying to make a play and vice versa.

I like that you would recommend support to any new player though, not just girls. Anecdotally, new guy players get a more in depth explanation on different characters and how cool they are, but the new girls are just tossed in a role where they can 'learn but also not be in the way'. 

Personally, i dont think support is a good way to learn the game. When everyone is new, no one knows how to cs or do any of the other nonsense. Let them play in their elo.

The other definition refers to **performative** aspects of being a man or woman that can change depending on the time or place. For example, wearing a skirt is considered feminine and something that women do, but that is performative. It's not biology. It's not a scientific factor in determining one's sex, like having XY or XX chromosomes. And there are cultures where men wear skirts and it isn't considered feminine at all. This is the definition of gender most people are using when talking about being trans or non-binary. 

Being non-binary I believe just means you don't neatly fit into what society considers male or what society considers female.

I love how nonbinaries claim they're being revolutionary and tearing down gender roles by wearing pants or skirts sometimes, then turn around and say shit like this. 

Usually, people on Reddit just have no experience with women, but apparently, you have no experience with either men OR women.
 
>literally their entire lives and everything they do is all over the spectrum of gender

Like normal people, stupid? The vast majority of people don't act as caricatures of their gender, they just exist, without having to define everything as masculine/feminine and worrying about how others perceive them like that. I have tomboy friends who aren't ashamed to like feminine things without calling themselves a trans polysexual gay enby. 

Do nonbinaries eat their food in a nonbinary way? Do nonbinaries play basketball in a nonbinary way? Do nonbinaries shit themselves in a nonbinary way? How about men? Or women? 

Please, tell me what is the ""womanly"" way of eating my food, so I can correctly live my life as a woman, since you apparently think everything I do has to be feminine. Can you tell me how to write my comments in a womanly way too? How about the womanly way of taking the train? Can you tell me that? I mean, I'm a woman, so obviously, every minute of my existence has to be feminine after all, otherwise I'd be nonbinary. Oh shit, am I actually a nonbinary? Oh god. I need to buy new pants. I only own 2 pairs. And maybe they're too *feminine*! Can you help me buy nonbinary pants, please? What's the difference between nonbinary pants and normal pants? Maybe they have bigger pockets?

I havent played that gargabe but i would imagine either her E cd is reduced every time she jumps on her W or its ridiculously low already that you dont even need to get reset. When she jumps she just needs to ult for 2 sec and then get jump again and that usually kills at least 1 person if not more and that gets you another reset and you can do it all over again million times. Even if they stun you it will probably be when you already jumped so you already did W dmg and ult dmg in the same time (for some reason) and they got from 100-20% hp in 1 sec. Not to mention that she has always been ap assasin but now she just needs to chill and buy lifesteal and shes suddenly strongest 1v1 mid laner in the game. Not to mention that those blades on the floor just give her easy escape and possibility that she can just jump on the floor instead of the champion or at least a ward. She was always not that hard to play but at least you could have countered her effective and it was fun in the game.

1549,0.14083967,BRO your speaking the language of my heart. I got to Diamond 1 elo with her and then they took out DFG and reworked her. Can hardly win games on my silver smurf with her now.
1550,-0.14800207,Also don’t play with your friends if they’re assholes; I don’t really mind but I’ve had at least 4 pentas intentionally stolen by a que mate
1551,0.46876872,Kat’s definitely a time investment but a worthwhile one. You can get pentas pretty easy with her cuz that’s not what’s hard about her kit; I think her kits major learning curve is learning to play around her many poor lane matchups. I have 160k mastery and I’m still learning this
1552,-0.6743216,">I havent played that gargabe but i would imagine either her E cd is reduced every time she jumps on her W or its ridiculously low already that you dont even need to get reset. 

I suggest you do try playing that 'garbage', so you can learn what it does and subsequently how to play against it. Her E cooldown is reduced by a % every time she jumps on a dagger, this scales up with level. Early game her E is on a 3s cooldown *after picking up a dagger*.

>When she jumps she just needs to ult for 2 sec and then get jump again and that usually kills at least 1 person if not more and that gets you another reset and you can do it all over again million times.

If she ults for 2 seconds, she should die. She cannot move while ulting, it's easy to hit an immobile target with abilities. Her standard combo is E-W-Q-Gunblade-R-E, this is only enough to kill a squishy target if Kat is ahead, as the one in the clip is.

>Even if they stun you it will probably be when you already jumped so you already did W dmg and ult dmg in the same time (for some reason) and they got from 100-20% hp in 1 sec.
...no? W dagger takes 1.25s to land after casting, Ult takes 2.5s to deal it's full damage - you mainly only use this to apply grievous wounds and keep damage up while waiting for daggers to land. In the clip they only melt so fast because *kat is fed* and they do not itemise against it - they are punished for poor play, as they should be.

>Not to mention that she has always been ap assasin but now she just needs to chill and buy lifesteal and shes suddenly strongest 1v1 mid laner in the game.

This is just objectively wrong. Kat buys gunblade, which is *omnisteal*, not lifesteal. She is not the strongest 1v1 mid laner in the game by quite some margin, in fact she is actually *weak* in 1v1 scenarios, her strength is cleaning up teamfights with resets.

>She was always not that hard to play but at least you could have countered her effective and it was fun in the game.
Old Kat was pretty facerolly, but new Kat is actually *exceptionally difficult* to play from a micro perspective. You need to have good decision making, quick mechanics, you need to be able to predict your opponents and accurately judge your damage to get resets. If you do not get resets, you are useless. I don't understand what you mean by ""countered her effective and it was fun"", new Katarina has a much larger window for counterplay. For example, her E has a 0.15s cast time and 0.85s command buffering delay, her W takes 1.25s to land, she needs to wait for Q dagger to land after casting, the aforementioned 3s cd on E early *with dagger* (14s without). The champion is fine.

>This is just pure trash and people only play her when they are stuck so they can hopefully win by cheeseing others

I'm sorry but this is just salt talking. You cannot realistically complain about a champion if you do not take the time to understand their strengths and weaknesses. When I see Kat get locked in I enjoy the free lane."

1757,-0.21609938,[deleted]
1758,-0.43835038,During the first game LS spoke a lot about not ping ponging lanes and wave management. One of the examples he gave was not taking an early inhib so he got to see his advice in practice.
1759,0.07766323,Shut up Caleb
1760,0.17349231,"Taking an inhib will cause that lane to be perpetually pushed and I believe someone did the math a long time ago but an inhib gives like 2-3 levels of exp so if you’re taking an inhib and aren’t able to do anything with the pressure or objectives arent coming up soon enough for it to matter, you’d just be giving the enemy team free exp."
1761,-0.19743517,"Inhibs are taken so you can apply pressure elsewhere that can win you the game. Pre-20 minutes, there’s no Baron or other game-winning plays available, so taking inhib would end up creating a lane that your opponent can farm real easily, while you can’t because it will be constantly pushing."
1762,-0.09735738,"because that means the enemy team is getting a bigger amount of gold and xp in a lane and it's permanently pushed towards them, so you will miss out on minions too. If you had a realistic chance to end the game it'd be good but it's too early to do so, also you can't threaten baron / soul / elder."
1763,-0.2742903,"Basically you're sending a ton of experience and gold your enemy's way. At that point you're not in a position where you can capitalize on an inhibitor. Mid is the worst inhibitor to take because it doesn't force people away from the epic monsters (generally botlane inhib is the most valuable simply because it physically puts defenders the furthest away from Baron). If you take that mid inhibitor your wave is going to permanently push into the enemy and the enemy won't really lose access to contest for objectives. 

Even if the wave crashed on the nexus turrets, mid inhib is the only inhibitor where all creeps can be targeted by both turrets simultaneously, meaning it's the one that deals less damage to turrets overall. Creeps also don't funnel into one turret, so the damage is spread across the two, further diminishing potential damage that is going to be regened anyway. Your team will have a hard time farming the creeps that meet your super waves, not only because they'll be further in and riskier because of it, but because supers make damage calculations for lasthitting very hard. The buffed siege minions twoshot creeps, and it also buffs the casters' attack. 

The creeps themselves aren't that hard to clear for the enemy team because their HP scale with game time. A 35 min super is infinitely tankier than a 20 minute one. Basically, you're just permafreezing a lane on their side of the map when you don't really have anything to do objective wise to make it a decent tradeoff."
1764,-0.21737541,"You can't really farm the lane that has supers, so if you take an inhib this early, the map pressure doesn't amount to much and you just fall behind in farm and xp."
1765,-0.1315847,"The lane is always pushed to their side, so they can just waveclear it and get massive amounts of gold while you cannot get any resources from that lane anymore. You have to live of their jungle and objectives to make up for it."
1766,-0.05669663,I'd you take an inhib too early you can't actually do anything with it so you just feed the enemy team super minions.
1767,-0.610612,"I think mid lane inhib (especially this early) is the worst one to take, because the enemies will clear with impunity and be able to access river to contest both Baron and Drakes. As others pointed out, you're also losing experience.

On the flipside, if SKT lost bottom inhib, they'd have a pressure point on the bottom side of the map which is REALLY bad if you need to contest baron."
1768,-0.16592084,"It's basically killing that lane, you cannot gain anything from that lane after you destroy an inhib (except for pressure obviously) because your epic minions will destroy enemy waves. Meanwhile, your enemy can farm that lane and gain more exp and gold and sometimes it's enough for enemy to come back into the game, depending on how long they can stall."
1769,-0.02708794,Because it pushes the lane automatically so it gives a ton of resources that could be denied over to the enemy team. Of course it isn't the strictly worse play if they aimed to win pre-20 minutes.
1770,-0.34843627,"To add up to the comment above:

If you take an inhibitor, then that lane is pushed for the next 5 minutes. You would have to overextend to actually farm the waves, meaning you either risk getting ganked and killed, or you can't earn gold/experience from that lane."

1816,-0.4343478,It heavily depends on what inhib it is. Top + mid inhib? really bad to take because ryze can easily clear superwaves and those waves are close enough to baron that you cant pressure it easily. Deciding to take an inhib or not is dependant on 1. your ability to pressure nash - t1 has cassio which is already pretty good so if this was 20 minutes in they could do baron and take inhib. 2. how good the enemies are at clearing inhib minions - do they have a magic damage dps that can clear minions easily? might not wanna take it then. Do they have senna who takes them very slowly? worth considering taking it. 3. Which inhib it is - if you are playing on blueside botlane inhib is much more worth to take because its the furthest away from nash which means if someone was defending bot waves you could rush nash easily. Mid especially is very easy to defend so its by far the worst inhib to take.
1817,-0.2228947,"16 minutes, you can’t push shit and it just allows the other team to comeback much faster."
1818,-0.44884524,"> i guess the pressure midlane would allow you to take all outer turrets though?

Not without giving up way too much. You can just have, say, your ADC hold down the mid lane, while the rest of your team defends the outers. At this point in the game, towers are really powerful still and a 1-man advantage won't guarantee you a good fight like it does later on in the game. It's likely they'd just trade towers or not get anything at all. 

At 19 minutes it depends. A 5v4 at baron can quickly turn bad especially with the debuff and mid lane isn't so great for the baron set up either, as the entire team can just clear mid as 5 and walk to baron from there."
1819,-0.19899881,"probably considered not worth if you're deflating your lead that way, the lane is still super long with the inhib standing and you can push it in before going elsewhere"

1823,-0.11005086,t1 at this point is stronger so they will get mid push anyway - they dont need the help of super minions. Taking outers at this point is just a matter of time anyway they are not as important to winning the game as just farming 4-5 waves of superminions.

If you rotate bot-to-mid-to top you can create 5v3 situations top-lane as long as you have pressure while taking up enemy jungle.

If you are pushed back to your mid-inhib, it is quite ackward to retake your own jungle, and thus the freezing team needs to take ackward pathing in order to defend outer turrets. They can really only defend their outer inhib turrets. 

> and mid lane isn't so great for the baron set up either, as the entire team can just clear mid as 5 and walk to baron from there.

Which then effectievely prevents the freeze. Hence as long as the fear of the enemy team taking objectives out on the map is stronge enough and the enemy team needs to push mid-wawe, it is benefical to take the inhib."

Vayne in a single lane (say bot) ready to push or 1v1 if you leave her alone there, farming it up.

Top and Jgl defending top turret and scouting jungle for any collapse.

Mobo boots support hovering between top and bot and rotating faster than you would (because of mobos) to support either lane, with a focus on warding / scouting bot jungle (to support my Vayne).

By all rights, there is no way HLE should have the damage to teamfight against a hyper carry, a very strong teamfighter who consistently got amazing ultimates, and a bruiser who got several amazing flanks onto the solo carry. The amount of damage Ornn can bring to the table as a tank is just way too much for the amount of CC, tankiness, and RANGE his abilities have. Don't even get me started on the soraka insanity this game as well. In every fight, you can see the moment anyone attempts to get on her, her passive just turbo-boosts her somewhere safe or she gets a singular heal and she's back to full.

2389,-0.1350198,">Hle dmg wasnt a problem.

That's my point, it should have been a problem.

Olaf didn't build damage and yet with utility items like Righteous Glory he was running down the damage dealers of HLE.

You can argue that he was alive for 3 times longer than he would be if he didn't have a Soraka Yuumi, which is fair. But by default, if people who build tank actually tanked instead of dealing damage you wouldn't run into these problems to begin with rather than nerfing Soraka + Yuumi and waiting for the next enchanter to heal Olaf into going 1v5.

Not saying Olaf is the only example of the issue but he's one of the main champions who can abuse it for sure."
2390,-0.2137548,"One, I'm not in favor of Yuumi.

However you're giving your personal opinion and masking it as a fact. Yuumi, like many champions before her (including but not limited to Akali) can be balanced. Yuumi's design is unique and there's plenty of people who will enjoy her for whatever reason, and that's enough to give her a place in League imo. We need more unique champions to appeal to all the fucked up fellas out there.

That said, Yuumi isn't the problem. The problem is champions like Olaf who are capable of building tank and utility (not even full tank) and just run down carries with auto attacks and targeted true damage.

Yuumi and Soraka as enchanters simply play on the fact that if you keep Olaf alive for a bit he's going to 1v4. Try doing the same with Ornn, Sion or any other tank and see if they can go 1v3 or 1v4 and win. This is a problem with certain champions having too much damage while building utility (not even straight tank, as Righteous Glory is more utility than tank).

Olaf isn't the only offender but as the one who can build SV and tank and deals damage mostly through auto attacks and targeted true damage hits, he's definitely one of the main beneficiaries of enchanters being out there."

Traditionally assassins e.g. Zed, Talon, Rengo, Kha would be the solution, but since supports can miss their peel, but still out heal and shield any burst damage, champs are no longer going to die from all ins. I think we do need an item which ignores shields or does additional damage on a shielded user, but only for proxy shields, or at least stronger on proxy shields. However I do think shield stacking needs to be nerfed, you can all in a champ as Zed, Talon etc and hit them with everything, yet they just use their own shield plus seraphs and tank everything, and trying to all in them when CDs are down is pretty much useless now due to all the free CDR supports get."

>There is literally no lore whatsoever surrounding this as a possibility, Sona has no signs of being affected by Darkin blood magic (and no, she did not do what Shadow Assassin Kayn did to Rhaast), and the etwahl is an Ionian instrument. Why would a Shuriman Ascendent have an Ionian instrument as a weapon to be sealed in by the Aspect of Twilight? Ionia is on a whole different continent and the ancient Shuriman empire was not known to travel the seas and conqueror on other continents.

>To expand further on the Darkin blood magic part, a physically weak host will be destroyed by their magic. An ideal host has a strong body, or the Darkin uses multiple bodies (in Aatrox's case, hundreds) to sustain themselves if the body isn't capable of withstanding the form they force upon it. Kayn is a student of Zed and is very strong physically, and Varus had to fuse two people for a suitable host, although this backfired as he has issues snuffing out their conscious. Tryndamere would be a dream host for Aatrox, as would the likes of Olaf or Illaoi, but he uses whatever comes by for the sake of escaping the darkness of being trapped within his sword. Sona isn't anything like the aforementioned people, she would be grounded meat from the power of blood magic being forced on her.

>Also, Darkin cannot move inside their weapons, and they tend to control whoever seizes them immediately and not wait for a suitable host, so no one can move etwahl about without becoming host, assuming it is a Darkin (it isn't).

The other person kinda declared the etwahl being a Darkin as fact, while you say its just a conspiracy, but just throwing that out to explain the tone of the quote. Sona lore is bad, as are a good chunk of orher champs, so fair enough you have nothing to work with and are just having fun.

i don't think ionia is really a place of interest for darkin at all

valmar(?) and kai(?), the two dudes controlled by varus are ionian, yes, but varus himself(itself?) isn't. all darkin iirc are shuriman by nature, seeing as how they're corrupted forms of shuriman ascended (not baccai/failed ascended as in xerath but think nasus or renekton with serious ptsd after the war with the void in icathia.) varus himself(itself?) was locked away in a bow and taken as a personal weapon by an ancient ionian queen.

as for kayn, he, too, is not ionian. he was a noxian child soldier taken in by zed during the noxian invasion of ionia. even rhaast isn't ionian. i did mention that the darkin originated in shurima, but even ignoring that, rhaast was uncovered in an ancient noxian ruin, and stolen by kayn so that it wouldn't get to be used by the noxians against ionia

so all in all, of the three darkin that we know of so far, one has recently been tormenting the people of the freljord and fighting targonian pseudo-ascended (aatrox), one was uncovered in noxus and taken by a noxian defector to ionia (rhaast), and only one was actually locked away in ionia (varus), which makes the ionian connection dubious at best.

as for the rest, i haven't read any of sona's lore so i couldn't attest to any of it, but tbh i'm kinda hoping sona's etwahl doesn't turn out to be the next darkin. riot has mentioned that this season they want to focus less on creating new characters and more on bringing lore characters to life (a la senna) and i'd rather the sister be a full fledged champ than a rehashed sona or skin."

The problem with the low PR was not solved but was never the goal. He is just a champ that isn't liked as his style is so different but also more boring for most players.

Just because you have a high winrate doesn't mean it's a dedicated player base. It could be the champ is just overtuned.

And just because you have a low pick rate also doesn't mean it's a dedicated player base. Some champs are simply not popular at all and have breath or depth of players.

In fact, a couple of years ago this was confirmed to be true by [this riot post](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/11/champ-popularity-mixing-math-art/). **In here you can clearly see A-sol does NOT have a player base that has lots of games on him. His depth is very low and his breath is very low.** This simply means not many people play him AND not many people main him. He is unpopular in every way possible.

Old Sol was an extremely powerful champion, but achieving that power required effort and time to learn how he played and how he felt. More so than any other champ in the game, learning to play Old Sol was extremely satisfying and rewarding.

I can't really bring myself playing ranked this season... 
Every champion i remotely liked (besides Syndra) is now braindead, reworked or in a completely different role."
2637,-0.20335944,"One thing I would say is that I think the star mechanic is actually not really why Aurelion Sol isn't played. I think it's the fact that one of his basic abilities is a long cooldown roaming tool. Many people just can't take advantage of having such a low cooldown roam without losing lane too badly. And if you get behind in lane, it becomes super costly to roam constantly.

But the thing is, he has to be balanced around having such a strong roaming tool. Which means that if you don't use it, the champ ends up feeling kind of weak and underwhelming. 

Personally, I like DPS mages with interesting mechanics, so potentially Aurelion Sol could be right up my alley, but I'm just not good enough at managing mid lane and having the proper map awareness to pull off the constant roams, let alone successful roams.

On the other hand, I have played him, and I don't find the star mechanic is really that hard to manage once you get used to it. I've played him on Howling Abyss. I believe he is buffed on that map, because he doesn't have to be balanced around roaming all the time. You mostly use his E for getting back to lane and chasing, the two easiest and most straightforward things to use it for. And on that map he is fairly easy to play and fun.

So this rework actually didn't do anything really. They just shifted some things around. What they should've done is switch his E and R. That way, his roam would be on a longer cooldown, so he wouldn't have to be balanced around roaming constantly. Furthermore, it would be a lot easier to use, since it would be a very clear and obvious opportunity for a playmaking tool when you have it up, like a Twisted Fate ult.

And also having Aurelion Sol's R tuned down on put on a short cooldown I think would make him a bit easier too, since it would give him a consistent way to keep enemies at star range.

Not that I don't think this wouldn't alienate some of his playerbase. I know a lot of them love the early roaming playstyle. But if they wanted to make him more accessible, I think that would be the way to go."

PS i had 800k mastery points on him

opgg: IloveSelenaGomez"
2647,0.23937783,"He will never be “popular” like a yasuo, akali, or ahri because his kit is designed around control and rotations rather than doing flashy shit. Most of the hate I see is for new W; while I agree it changes the feel of the champ, people do not seem to appreciate how versatile an on demand movespeed boost makes Asol in fights. 

The E as well, different feel but also different power budget. Have you ever sat mid and just looked at the range indicator of his E? What about from fountain to midlane? It’s almost TF ult range, and is unbelievably powerful at all stages of the game. The passive movespeed loss sucks for fishing for roams, but the compensation was definitely there.

Lastly all the QoL buffs he got on Q helped a lot. You used to just be fucked if you didn’t have ult and an assassin jumped you, but with early cancel q and the w movespeed boost you actually have a chance now. The little speed boost you get moving towards your q in motion also makes those more consistent. Conqueror helped a lot too, but a lot people who play Asol are divided on that. I still think it’s by far his best keystone compared to electrocute or phase rush. 

I guess I must be in the minority who didn’t mind those changes all that much. I’m totally fine with him being a bit of a niche champ personally"

It's mainly the same people who were playing him before. And they either like it or deal with it because it didn't change him enough to stop liking him. 

The problem, if we're to say there is one, is that they didn't go far enough. His core mechanic is boring. Nevermind the fact it doesn't fit into the game thematically, it feels like a design for a season 2 champion. Like a combination of Singed and Anivia but with even less versatility. He even has the classic one-ability-is-just-a-passive trope of a lot of the earlier designs.

Again, factually untrue. He cannot instantly kill the minion wave until he has points in W and some AP. Ziggs can clear just as fast and impact sidelanes with R, Xerath as well. Kassadin can Q old Sol to stop the fast push, Yasuo can all-in or fast push mid tower while Sol Roams. TF can ult to follow, Taliyah can do the same.

I'm excited to see Broxah join TL. For anyone who has been watching him stream for *any* period of time, you'll notice how educational and positive he is at all times! 

If his presence on a team is anything like on stream, I think this wholesome giant will do wonders for the team's performance.

I don't totally understand what people mean when they say Broxah is aggressive, quite frankly it just sounds like a term which translates into nothing (except maybe risk-taking and mechanics? but that is quite the stretch and still does not contribute much). Broxah received a lot of criticism for his 2019 performance and a few people at the higher level have quite some harsh words for him. Also, looking at worlds, TL had a lot of problems that had nothing to do with the jungler. So let's see what will happen."

How is this relevant? The reason I'm pro native talent is because the facts overwhelmingly point to developing native talent as being better for the competitiveness of the region. I don't understand how the fact that I have extensively researched this issue somehow makes my points less valid -- if anything it makes them more valid.

>Like we fail internationally every year because our players can't keep up with the competition.

You know why our players can't keep up? Because the import bias in NA means they hardly get chances. EU doubled down on developing talent and they have surpassed Korea at the last few international events. NA doubled down on imports and have slumped further down. The evidence is clear and convincing: over-importing is BAD for a region. Native talent is the only way to find any kind of success."

People put an asterisk next to Houston’s win because they knew the Bulls weren’t at their full strength and couldn’t even make it to the finals.

As far as the removal of sightstone and tracker’s knife, I wouldn’t consider them to be in the same context as TL not having Broxah. Literally missing a starting player is much different than the meta changing to something your region isn’t that good at. The meta constantly changes and has pretty much changes every year at Worlds and Korea still dominated.

He is definetly not on jankos level, has potentially trouble to contest xerxe (who looks clean) and may be contested by blaber

jensen - eh... bad worlds, meh msi. no top 3 western mid. might possibly not even top 3 in NA if froggen, nisqy and po€ or bjerg show up.

DL - great domestically and outside of his weak international performance is most likely a top 3 or top 5 adc in the west (rekkles, perkz(now caps? who is unclear) upset. Til now kobbe and now zven all look or looked better or even)

Okay.

If they fall out of contest, old, familiar champs come back in, and suddenly the players that we're good at the old champs before, become more relevant again. Also Dragons are pretty important, maybe not for early, but stacking them in prep for soul is big. Teams mindsets should start keeping that in mind.

I do think it’s important that TL learn how to play and win through other lanes though, as their “win through bot” style doesn’t always work, especially internationally. So I think DL should shut up and master Senna and other picks like that in order to give the team more flexibility."

Maybe I should've been more clear that I don't place the blame solely on Jenson, but nobody else on the team was playing Qiyana either, and I suppose people assumed it was a very Jenson pick (or at least I did), so the fact that neither he nor anyone else on TL ever played it is just strange."

C9 on the other hand discarded the aggressive Svenskeren with the psychotic Blaberfish who is way more aggressive and they completely revamped their botlane (which was, even tho some people claim different things, their biggest weakness).

Both Teams have high skill players and ultimately both can either fail or bring glory to NA. Multiple Superteams managed to mess up while some teams with rather unknown players before entered the scene with a boom.

Lets be honest here if KT didnt choke so hard in draft AGAIN DRX wouldnt win this series. I dont think DRX will be competing for anything this year and Deft is wasting his remaining years at yet another ""project"" that will take years to pop up. So dissapointed with the massive over-reliance on complete rookies to save them if it works then hats off for them but if it doesnt... yeah Chovy, Deft plzz rethink bout ur decision and leave if u can.

Humans already have a hard time understanding a strangers perspective is in real life, let alone in a complicated game where the most basic of voice comms aren't allowed.   


Lee's perspective was probably ""I spent a bunch of time waiting to come behind this Kat and Aniva didn't follow up. Going to tax because she wasted my time"" (not defending the second part) and Anivia is thinking ""please don't gank I have a freeze going"" but neither side communicates.

 I am not saying lee sin made the right move here, but maybe lee sin just doesn't realize the mistake he is making; obviously junglers outside of very high elo will most likely understand wave manipulation particularly well. I know I personally just ask laner after a gank what to do with wave and listen to what they say. Even if it is the wrong move, it is better than tilting the laner.

I know I have seen a lot of jungle guides talking about how important it is to tax/leech exp in order to stay leveled as jungle in s10."
3828,-1.4234676,this is why ranked in league has and will always be a horrible system. It doesn't address anything. Literally nothing that leads to wins is accounted for. Imagine if michael jordan was paid the same as the rest of his team yet in league we reward the same LP to the 0-10 as the 10-0

3830,-0.25766537,"It pains me that there are players like this Lee in D4 who pay no heed to wave management and resorts to actual griefing just because a gank didn’t go the way they wanted it to.

While I don’t condone afking because it encourages an overall more toxic environment for players, I understand the reason behind Anivia’s decision to afk. This might not be the first time this has happened to the player, and could have been the last straw for him. 

Either way, I’d say it was the Lee’s fault to begin with, and as a diamond 4 player he should know better. But it’s league and majority of matches are rife with toxicity, even in ARAM, so shit happens."
