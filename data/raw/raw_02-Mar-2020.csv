* /r/summonerschool - great for new players and for experienced players that want to share their knowledge

* /r/loreofleague - great for discussion about lore

* /r/LoLFanArt - a good place to see and share fan art of the game

* /r/rule34lol - the x-rated version of lolfanart (NSFW)

* /r/leagueofmemes - all the memes you could ever want

* /r/teamfighttactics - check it out for all your TFT needs

* /r/LegendsOfRuneterra - check it out for your LoR needs

* And there are also hundreds of champion main subreddits. I personally love /r/zyramains. Generally the naming of these subreddits is something like /r/[champion name]mains

As an oldtimer, they are sequentially destroying good things from the past.

I'm a Reddit user, but I hate when complex subjects, in our case an MOBA, gets exclusively on Reddit. Reddit is good to follow on simple straight forward categorization. 

When you take into consideration a game has (and the boards reflect that): art, game feedback, game discussion/memes, lore, competitions etc. it's hard for those not to get lost in the Reddit wall mixing up, even with good flair systems.

For example, the /r/leagueoflegends it's full of eSports. I respect that, but I personally not a fan of lol esports.

 Like maybe if you updated the site more regularly like it was UNUSABLE FOR MOBILE since they updated the website people would use it more!!!! 

I saw this coming so I started going to reddit more often and I guess I made the right choice. But it still sucks since I don't like how reddit looks, the community is much more into esports, and there's too many people so I feel like my comments are pointless since a post has hundreds.

God who ever at riot that keeps deciding to shut things down needs to just say we're doing this ONLY TO SAVE MONEY and nothing else. Like that's the reason people did use the boards and it wasn't a small number either if you compare it to reddit it is but almost all forms are like that. 

Honestly it really does feel to me riot doesn't care about the community. Like the wukong rework not be able to have effect changes after saying he would, the client barely works, riot basically killing every mode that's not aram or summoner rift, Rotating game modes are just 90% urf and 10% poro king which sucks, and now this.

I don't know that as we're built now is going to be good for boards users coming in for server issues (e.g. we don't want all other posts flooded by my server isn't working), but there is definitely going to need be a balance. 

One thing we've learned is that issues can be intermittent even from regions. To be honest, we're probably going to have to monitor how things change and go from there. We're also just not in a spot like boards where we're divided by server. 

What happens in NA for example, won't effect EU servers - so not all of our user base cares or wants to see it.

This is a pretty specific example, but the same can be said with litterally every recent questionnable balance decisions.

Also add in the fact that the boards were always plagued with one-sided people only caring about their mains defending to their death said main from any discussion, no matter the stats, and you can already see why people who actually cared just stopped doing so. 

I remember a specific Gameplay thread who discussed about Ahri's rework making her already above-average performances blast through the roof at the time. Not only did this issue get completely ignored by Riot until her winrate calmed down, but the person making this thread got straight up insulted by several people with... well Ahri profile pictures.

251,5e5d2f8fa3cf97edf5d968d6,"I still don't think you understand the concept for either point.
If a player can feel upset about something without Riot intending for them to that is bad design.

They definitely have the power to control all outcomes within the game but are either not working hard enough or haven't got the ideas to create solutions to these problems.

Conceptually Riot wants you to associate and have happy and empowering experiences while playing League. If you get to the point where you are frustrated enough to go to the forums and ask for changes then Riot is doing something wrong.

If you are the guy in your example and you don't know why you lost  but felt like you played well you are going to ask for buffs to your champ or nerfs to your enemy.
What if you lose to someone with 90% WR ? asking for a buff is fine here in theory to bring your champ and the other champ in line ( although it would be a lot of work for all the other champs). Also a champ that you think you should counter and you lose would be a prime time for Riot to step in and teach you why you lost so you can have the courage to blame yourself, otherwise its a lot easier to blame Riot ( especially considering most people don't check the WR's of champs).

TLDR: If Riot creates negative emotions in you unintentionally they have failed as the principle of all games is to either create a journey of emotion ( story games) or to create positive or empowering emotions.

Thats both not true AND irrelevant to the point.

&#x200B;

You can absolutely be irrational in your feeling bad, and there can absolutely be situations where one feels bad that are still good game design. Like, you literally have people who feel bad every time they lose, do you think ""players losing"" is bad game design?

&#x200B;

And you're still arguing something that defies basic reasoning, so I can only repeat myself:

&#x200B;

Even if something is not perfect, complaints about it CAN STILL BE UNREASONABLE. This isnt hard to understand. Like, I dont even understand how this could possibly be contentious for you. Again, if someone is complaining about how they're losing games and feel bad, and that their champ should have 100% WR and they should win every game, is that reasonable just because the game isnt perfect?",The Boards are dead.

It doesn't matter if its irrational, humans aren't rational.

If the player doesn't have the ability to see their mistakes and Riot aren't creating the situation so they can see them then they are failing the player.

The complaints are a biproduct of something being wrong, whether its the player or not is irrelevant. Riot is fully withing their power to turn their crap experience into a good one and that is their job. Losing doesn't make most people complain, most think "" i can get better"" if it is obvious why they lost. What happens to most is they lose and go "" i played well using my champion, how did i lose?"" and then they try to fill in the gaps, mostly blaming team mates or champion balance even if they played bad because they didn't even know they was playing bad and they didn't know they made a mistake.",The Boards are dead.

It also doesnt look as fast paced/deathbally as overwatch,which makes for more room for strategic play and getting your bearings.

I like the simple CS like gunplay.

Looks like a decent compromise between CS gunplay,and Overwatch moba heroes style.


The only issues i have at the moment with what i watched,are that characters have a lot of bright colors on them,blue LED's/bright orange gear,that really bright poison wall ability,or whatever that was ,that all look out of place compared to the terrain.

Should tone down the bright colors on characters and abiltiies.Or alternatively,liven up the terrain with brighter and vibrant colors.

There's also so much shit going on in the UI.

Should reduce the size of the map,to like a third of what it is right now,and remove some of the clutter on the hp/skill bar,with the art.All those lines and art between skills are unnecessary.

**Edit: my problem isnt that characters are sticking out and you can easily discern them from the environment,its just that aesthetically they feel out of place,for example in counter strike,they sort of feel like they are blending in nicely,same color palette,same art direction,here its like you threw anime characters in a cs environment,nothing about the clarity it provides is bad**",VALORANT: Riot Games' competitive 5v5 character-based tactical shooter,2020-03-02 09:11:10

It's a hero shooter but they aren't going full OW/TF2 with it, it'll be closer to Rainbow 6 Siege if I had to guess with each character having a niche for helping on certain maps or strats. basically each character would be a ""loadout"" to pick-up start of round. A bit worried about the fact that there's healing and full-on rezzes but we'll have to see how it plays out, Siege isn't too far away with how it allows these though.

548,5e5d3003a3cf97edf5d96d7c,"Game looks really good so far. I like the you have to buy the abilities as utility, like CSGO. It'll make those first/eco rounds pretty dynamic as far as what to expect. I like how clean the visuals are, CSGO (Especially now) has had some problems with visual clarity in certain circumstances; so the sleek aesthetics are a god send. 

The ultimate abilities seem reasonably attainable and likewise unattainable. A 7 kill streak is easy enough to shut down, and funneling doesn't really work in a tactical shooter environment so a playstyle like that is generally out of the question. So I don't think a massive majority of the playerbase has to worry about constant revives and flying kunais being hurled at them.

The one thing I'm not to sure about is the buy-phase boundaries and 3 bombsite maps. This is more aimed at the lower skilled shooter players who don't understand the concept of playing for your life, or disengaging to play retake. But I can see a lot of tilted players spawning from getting 4v1d or 5v1d over and over. I don't see this as a huge problem or even a problem at all for even above average shooter players, but if leagues any metric to go by; above average players are statistically very uncommon/rare.

I do like the verticality to the bombsites though, adds a bit of flavor to gameplay and site taking/defending; whilst making a 1 person site defense not as difficult. There weren't too many bombsites in CSGO with nice vertical holds with strictly one sided CT access (Overpass comes to mind as an example *of*).

The guns look cool so far, I'm not the biggest fan of having one of the ARs switch firing modes based on ADS, though. But I'm just not a fan of burst weapons in general.

This game looks very similar to CSGO mechanically whilst also being very *very* different. I'm excited to see what this game becomes closer to release, and hope they deliver on their promises of 128T servers, <35 servers, and good net code.

617,5e5d300ba3cf97edf5d96e90,"I’m not sure if riot is taking our comments into consideration, but if they are, here’s my take on this. I don’t know what is just work in progress so I’m gonna assume everything is and everything isn’t at the same time? You know? First off some of these abilities feel really limiting to the bent teams play style, for example the wallhack ability will only be presumably countered by some other specific ability. And that really makes the game predictable and bland, “linear “ one thing riot worked hard to minimize with their champion reworks. Who knows maybe that’s the gameplay style they’re going for with this. I’m still excited for this game regardless. Another thing is, it feels kinda slow? Now I’m really not a fan of call of duty exo suits, those were really over the top just “for fun” elements that ruined the strategic aspect of the game and just made it a parkour galore. But in this video I seen 0 character bobbing, it felt like like ice cubes sliding on flat planes while holding guns... and there wasn’t much jumping or sliding or wall running and one way to distribute that is to made it like league. Have talon-like characters that can easily jump over stuff maybe not even as part or their abilities but part of their character CLASS, you know how fortnite kinda did that in their save the world mode? I thought that was well implemented, so if you played a sort of assassin you could get some extra move speed and a double jump if you selected that over wall running etc. Healers or yanks could run more slowly but have more health or resist or some debuff to the Enemy. I could go on and on here but I think you guys get it. As for the graphics, I don’t care much for those unless everything is clean and clear. So if that’s the style they’re going for I’m okay with it. I hope you listen to your playerbase as much as you do for league!

About 15 years ago on Counter-Strike 1.2 (not sure about the exact version but lower than 1.6), at the time when Warcraft 3 mod got popular, someone made a Warcraft CS mod. It had different races (orc, elf, human, undead) with abilities such as invisibility, passive life steal, chain lightning, stuns, resurrection etc. It was pretty fun and long before anyone came up with Overwatch or the likes.

690,5e5d3014a3cf97edf5d96fb4,"Let's be real, nearly all of the upcoming projects we've seen so far look honestly like low budget mobile games, so that was probably their intention to begin with.  Yes, some of the stuff they've shown off from the 10th anniversary looks good - but nothing of AAA caliber for a company of their size, that's for sure.  Which is understandable since China makes up a hefty chunk of their consumer base and they want their games to be playable on 3rd-world toasters... but it's still disappointing to think about.   This is probably the reason why I'm hyped for their animated shows the most.  Because those actually look like they're going to be pretty damn expensive, so you already *know* that Riot won't cut quality corners there.

Either way this game looks pretty generic and ""safe"" on all fronts, especially in regards  to the art direction and the character designs.

With shooters though the ping is super super critical even at elos like Silver3. The 40ms ping difference in a shooter feels like 200ms ping difference in a moba.

What Riot is doing is deploying servers to all major cities; instead of just having 1 set of east servers, 1 set of west, etc. People sitting beside those datacenters will be chilling at around 5-10 ping, people throughout the city will probably be on 15-25 ping and then people in the outskirts of the city will be 25-35 ping.

Overwatch is more MOBA-esque, the time to kill is pretty high, the game has a lot of focus on damaging enemies to build ultimates, so there are characters that take forever to kill even if your aim is great. An ulting soldier is powerful, but a character like roadhog can tank him for a while without dying. Same with Widowmaker, her ult is annoying, but there are tons of ways to stop it. 

This game makes me nervous because the TTK is so low that some of the abilities and ultimates seem either opressive or likely just...fluff. 

I'm sure it won't be completely unplayable, but it does seem like it'd be incredibly hard to balance. Overwatch has had a lot of trouble with the meta, to the point where they've had to do several things to ""force"" a meta so that people don't abuse certain mechanics.

OW, LoL, DotA, SC, Siege, WC, etc. all suffer from the same downside that it's hard to appreciate what's going on. I've played a lot of fucking video games, so I get the general idea of how MOBA's/RTS's work, but since they've never been my ""main"" game I don't really appreciate the sick plays going on.

On the other hand, you could watch Counter Strike with a friend that doesn't game and they'd get it pretty quick. The overall concept is easy to grasp and understand, you can appreciate a 3v1 clutch is cool even as a non-player. And the flashy headshots and flicks are more entertaining than MOBA abilities as a spectator sport IMO. It's like chess vs. football.

The round-based gameplay makes it much better too imo. It's always tense and nail biting, the suspense in a good pro game of CS is AWESOME.

1151,5e5d304ba3cf97edf5d976e8,">to find out why they failed and what would have made them successful

There's a few things that we can obviously see.

1) Overwatch's esports scene was incredibly artificial. Blizzard tried to make it way bigger than the actual pro scene and fanbase could support. In the process, they ran over the grassroots scene that did exist, which meant that years of development pre-OWL just dissipated.

2) They never figured out how to make an engaging spectator experience. Overwatch is a game awash with effects and big flashy abilities, and that plus being an FPS made it inherently hard to follow for viewers.

3) The balance was terrible. Overwatch is legitimately one of the worst esports I've ever seen balance-wise. Spectators had to suffer months on end of things like the Beyblade meta and GOATs meta. The meta would consistently boil down to the exact same comps with little or no variation, and Blizzard would be incredibly slow to fix it. It made for a poor viewing experience.

4) Going off of point #3, there are some inherent problems with the game's design that made these balance issues easy to happen. The lack of a draft and ability for each team to have the same heroes, the ability to duplicate heroes at first, the ability to swap heroes mid-game, the low hero count in general, the slow rate of balance changes, etc. all made for a surefire balance nightmare.",VALORANT: Riot Games' competitive 5v5 character-based tactical shooter,2020-03-02 14:29:38

1246,5e5d3057a3cf97edf5d97864,"On this i can agree more, but even in the most absolutely hilarious balance patches, the game itself was quite balanced overall. 

I'm not saying Riot never screw up (spoiler: they do), simply that they are doing a better job that they normally get credit for. 

Balancing a game like league, with well over and hundred different champions, an extremely invested and competitive playerbase, and thousands of different possibile interactions is way harder than people think. Sometimes the guys at Riot are stuff we don't, sometimes they miss the point completely, sometimes we catch stuff they missed. But overall, this game have never been so hilariously badly balanced to border unplayability, and with the mass of different kits that league has, in my eyes is no small feat.

(To the inevitable chance that someone will ask for this: yeah, we had our borderline madness weeks. Win Nhao, the debacle of release Syndra, Unlimited Ult Reset aka Darius, the class updates, and many more...but they were mostly circoscripted, and more importantly, lasted some weeks at most.

Hell, if any other cardgames not named Magic the Gathering had the same ammount of over-the-top cards Magic has, It would be called unbalanced as shit (admittedly, balancing two decades of cards is impossible).",VALORANT: Riot Games' competitive 5v5 character-based tactical shooter,2020-03-02 13:47:47

I see this more as a byproduct of Riot pushing for having simple champions, and simpler interactions than other similar games. While this lower the entrance bar for a normal player, It also removes a lot of viable strategies for a pro player, and make some champs way to predictable to stay in the meta for long (looking at you, Garen).

Add to this the fact that champion design has evolved so much in 10 years, that some champions basically obsolete other older ones...and you get fewer meta viable champions.

Add on top of this that some champions are better at some playstiles than others, and that meta is influenced by this...

Riot in years has done a good job in broadening the viable champion pool in competitive, but it's not enought i think.

The rotating meta thing is specifically aimed at competitive, and i already explained in another comment that, in my opinion, is a byproduct of the philosophy behind the fundamentals of LoL as a game. For the average soloq guy, the game is balanced, as you can win consistently with almost any champ, as winrates show you.

Juggs being strong right now is a byproduct of reddit bickering for a bruiser buff for months. Juggs are strong, yeah, so are bruisers like Renekton, Sett, Camille, Jax... we asked for it. We got it. We complain for it. Btw, only SOME of them are meta at high level, and they tend to be Easy to play, so stronger low elo, so they tend to be better the lower you go (Garen, anyone?)

Assassins aren't as strong as we all percieve them to be, as the only meta ones are Leblanc, Akali and Qyiana. Again, low Elo doesn't know how to play around assassins.

Funny as meta right know see a bunch of bot targeted bans, and yet everybody is here telling that ADCs are shit. Like, all of them, despite a bunch being played mid and top in competitive.

They differ from CS:GO in the sense that OW has a staggered map layout that transitions from objective 1 to 2, whereas in CS:GO the entire map is open and objectives 1 and 2 can be attacked by choice. This, in my opinion, gives greater strategic depth to CS:GO compared to Overwatch as it forces macro play that is more than just ""group up and use your hero abilities together"".

Of course, no doubt about that. It's just that I personally would prefer more mechanical gunplay in Valorant. If we assume that skill in CS:GO comes from gunplay, utility usage and map knowledge (that one including overall game sense), and Valorant is the same (replacing utility nades with abilities) but with primitive gunplay then it's hard to see how exactly it would manage to avoid having lesser depth of skill.

1389,5e5d3068a3cf97edf5d97aa0,"The fact that Fornite and Apex are completely different games is the reason why revive works for them, and works less well for a completely different game mode. Battle Royale does not play out the same way as SnD does. There is no point in trying to even compare the two in the first place, as the games play out differently.

&#x200B;

Search and Rescue not being competitive IS a relevant argument if you read my original comment. Valorant is obviously going to be pushed as a esport hence why the balance issue around revives (especially when only a couple of characters have access to them, pretty much making them an auto-pick). Siege also doesn't have it as bad despite everyone having the ability to revive because it's dependent on whether they even enter DBNO state. So even with Zofia and Doc in the mix, you have to first go DBNO. Headshots also circumvent DBNO, and many times the player still dies even while downed. The problem with Valorant is that even if you kill the player, they can still be revived. For example, Phoenix's Ultimate Ability is absolute bullshit, he can essentially entry for free. If you kill him, he revives safely and you give your position away. If you don't kill him to play around the duration of his ult, he kills you. See what I mean? Unless they find a perfect balance that is somehow fair but also keeping the ability relevant, I don't see how having these revive mechanics will be healthy for the game.

Any ""alpha"" footage shown at E3 has been either the final product they were going to put out anyways or a total fabrication that doesn't even make it into the game. These words mean nothing to the consumer at this point and are just a way for marketing to convince players they are getting early access to the game when the game has just released and now everyone gets to play through some bugs and the dev can pass off responsibility by saying ""it's just beta"". 

In normal software development he alpha phase is where the ""product"" is coming together. ""Feature complete"" means it does the general thing it's intended to do.

1437,5e5d306ea3cf97edf5d97b60,"Yep, sometimes hitting even like 38%. That often depends on the general playstyle on the map as those do have a stronger effect on you in Dota than in LoL. So changes to the map can somewhat be compared to a new champs release like Ivern/Yuumi with abyssal winrates. For example, Medusa had sub 40% wr but no major changes to her but the map and giving more space for farming instead of fighting increased hers to 45%.

I was only thinking of pro level though. There I feel that you have more variation in picking according to a game plan, even making low wr heroes work. For pubs, there is a meta and you will see some heroes in nearly every match and as there is little communication (relatively to pros) and you are more flexible in your hero pools than in LoL (often one maybe two roles with like three champs) you won’t see others.

Anyway, the question is what is balance. To me it is not that every hero is always viable but that there is a spot / niche for most of them (at least im pro play). That’s why I thought of Dota.",VALORANT: Riot Games' competitive 5v5 character-based tactical shooter,2020-03-02 11:18:51

The lower the elo, the more of a shitshow it becomes. There are always a couple of good picks for each role and as long as they are not ability reworked they will more or less fulfill their role regardless of slight nerfs or meta. Meta in general is about heroes that have an advantage over others whoch mostly comes into play at high levels where there is no great difference skillwise or from game understanding. At low levels you probably won’t lose because your hero is bad but because you yourself suck (at least at decision making). Same way for league where in Bronze you can play basically whatever you want but a Teemo support would get you punished heavily in most challenger games.

Dota is less about mechanics on a limited pool of heroes than it is about items and game decisions. Not saying that League doesn’t have those but Dota’s curse and blessing is the relative freedom you have. Losing a lane? Abandon lane and off to the jungle you go! Pick a not optimal hero? You can kinda(!) make up for it by item choices.

And yet Riot absolutely failed with the design of TFT and buttfucked the balancing.

Everyone who loves AutoChess and played it a lot will know/confirm that TFT is the boring and unskilled version of DAC.

1477,5e5d3073a3cf97edf5d97c00,"Not a gold standard really. But compared to LoL, Dota pros can make more heroes work so to me, that means that they are more playable options in a meta. A difference is as well that in Dita there isn’t too much of a OTP culture so in LoL people who play a certain bad champ and stick to it will do better than those occasionally play a bad hero.

As you mentioned there is always the struggle between patching for pros and pubs. Dota has rarely been well balaned in pubs, mostly with wr between 45 and 60%. But then again, looking at the stats on op.gg, LoL is in the same range.

But just in general, it is really hard to properly compare two games which have fundamental differences. An ADC is completely different to a position 1 in Dota. There are effectively two supports in Dota as there is no dedicated jungler.

It’s just that with the shifts of metas and buffs and nerfs, some niche characters like Mei became a lot stronger due to power creeping. This was because we had a long meta for a while where the meta was 3 tanks and 3 supports as sustain was strong enough to make it work. Characters got buffed and nerfed until the tank meta, GOATS, was kicked out by 2-2-2 role lock coming to the game, but it wasn’t until after this that people realized how strong characters like Mei had power creeped over the 8 month or so period the tank meta had lasted.

1615,5e5d3089a3cf97edf5d97e29,"It's honestly incredibly hard to make an intelligent AI for games like League without outright cheating (ie. ability tracking) because of how much player agency there is, and the abundance of skillshots.

Take the bot firing off a Morgana Q, for example: It's not as easy as sliding an accuracy bar up to 100% to make the Morgana never miss. Assuming that the client tracks values such as player speed, momentum, direction, mouse placement, etc, you can use these in tandem to calculate the spot with the highest likelihood of the player character moving into, and fire the ability there. The problem is, the player can ultimately change their mind at the last millisecond, meaning that no matter how intelligent the bots are they're always going to make mistakes as a result of unpredictability - as well as a million other factors which need to be accounted for like minions, other characters, their movement, your own movement, etc. 

This can be offset in a large way by machine learning (reinforcement learning is used as the basis of OpenAI), and after long enough (ie. enough training against itself) the AI will become good enough that it can accurately predict player movement far more than a hand written algorithm ever realistically could - it's just something that Riot would have to invest an immense amount of time and talent into, and this is a company who can't even make their client run without major issues for a month",I might have come across Faker on his Scuttle Crab account,2020-03-02 11:19:08

1657,5e5d308fa3cf97edf5d97ed1,"To quote a comment I left below in regards to this

> It's honestly incredibly hard to make an intelligent AI for games like League without outright cheating (ie. ability tracking) because of how much player agency there is, and the abundance of skillshots.

> Take the bot firing off a Morgana Q, for example: It's not as easy as sliding an accuracy bar up to 100% to make the Morgana never miss. Assuming that the client tracks values such as player speed, momentum, direction, mouse placement, etc, you can use these in tandem to calculate the spot with the highest likelihood of the player character moving into, and fire the ability there. The problem is, the player can ultimately change their mind at the last millisecond, meaning that no matter how intelligent the bots are they're always going to make mistakes as a result of unpredictability - as well as a million other factors which need to be accounted for like minions, other characters, their movement, your own movement, etc.

> This can be offset in a large way by machine learning (reinforcement learning is used as the basis of OpenAI), and after long enough (ie. enough training against itself) the AI will become good enough that it can accurately predict player movement far more than a hand written algorithm ever realistically could - it's just something that Riot would have to invest an immense amount of time and talent into, and this is a company who can't even make their client run without major issues for a month

It's not as simple as just giving the AI perfect aim and the perfect ability to dodge when it comes to training non-ML AI how to do new tricks. You're dealing with a thousand variables that all impact the ability for the AI to make these decisions - take dodging for example. 

An enemy skillshot flying towards you? Alright, presumably Riot are intelligent enough to track the position and projectile speed of skillshots, so the bot can essentially know when and where it's going to land, whether or not the path is going to collide with their position, and then use that information to attempt to avoid the ability. 

Here's where the problems start: they can use the movement speed of the AI character to calculate how long it'll take to move to a location in order to dodge the skillshot, and can be programmed to react accordingly. But they also need to calculate whether or not any paths along the way will cause them to be hit by additional skillshots. Or whether they'll be moving into an unfavourable position (which probably requires crazy logic in and of itself), or maybe they'll use an ability to avoid it when a player character would have held their dodge because they saw a Blitzcrank running up the lane who's now going to grip them - but it's incredibly hard to hard code all of this information and then calculate a plan based upon it, which is why basically all non-ML AI are janky as fuck no matter how hard developers try. And this is just one small aspect of dodging, which is a tiny aspect of the LoL AI themselves. 

Really long winded but I see stuff phrased like that a lot on game forums and it can lead people to think that adding better features is just *that easy* and then go mad when the developers don't do it",I might have come across Faker on his Scuttle Crab account,2020-03-02 11:36:21

1814,5e5d30a6a3cf97edf5d98148,"Ahhhh yes. 

Ok. To disprove your points. I think Ruin is not the best player by any means but i think he gets too much backlash from every side. E.g. how IWD flames him is far too much. 

Yesterdays match showed that he is not as bad as so many people say. He literally 1v9 that game. His equalizers and especially the one in botlane river was disgustingly good. 

Maybe now you can see that it was sarcasm. If not ... i am fine with that too. In the future i will be a little bit more calculated and careful with my sarcasm and how i live it.

That kind of information is always noted on the patch notes and has never been noted on the wiki. 

Now, they want to get rid of the forums..? History is so, so important for old, classic games like league. It’s interesting stuff and vital to understand how the game and champions have evolved over the years. 

I’m disappointed, to say the least. I hope someone can back this stuff up. I haven’t found any back ups except the way back machine in terms of archives for the old patch notes. I’m not sure if they warned about that being taken down or maybe I’m just missing how to view them now but yeah.

2127,5e5d3131a3cf97edf5d9862e,"Yea but them being on the boards is what made it amazing. 1) Reddit league is full of non gameplay discussion so going to boards guaranteed I could see it. 2) reddit, while much much better and much higher quality discussion also can have upvoted shit that is just wrong but you can’t do what you can on the boards. The beauty of the league boards and seeing the trending posts on there is that when I read them and see how wrong they are about the game is that they are posting on their league account! I get to copy their name into op.gg and see that they’re fucking silver and laugh at them! That’s why the boards are a fucking treasure (and okay sometimes good shit can actually get posted there so there’s that) On reddit I see some bad takes that make me say to myself “goddamn that has to be a low elo mindset / problem” but i don’t know what there account name is - I can’t look them up and have a laugh so it’s just more frustrating on reddit specially because people can and will lie about their ranks (yknow the memes about reddit challenjour) 

Like the boards were 90% shit, but they were convenient as I could always easily find gameplay discussion when I needed too (I wish this subreddit was better at this- not enough gameplay discussion gets upvoted and as a consequence it’s a lot more effort to find stuff). And really the fact that it was tied to a summoner name is so invaluable... fuck. RIP boards",Saying Farewell to Boards - League of Legends,2020-03-01 22:32:09

this ^^^

as a new player (just finished the training series last week), i didn't like that when i moved my mouse to the edge of my screen, the view shifts to that direction. i hated that.

so i googled it and found an answer way back in 2014 about [pressing F9 to disable it](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4371659).

i also didn't like how the chatbox was on the lower left by default so, again, i googled it and it [pointed me to the official forums for an answer](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Hvm6vJnh-help-with-chat-box-in-replays) so i can move it wherever i want.

if i posted these on reddit, the ppl checking /new will probably just ignore it because let's be honest, this subreddit is more for posting memes and stuff.

Many subreddits (like this one, for the most part) serve the purpose of an official board, but as they are community operated and hosted on a third party platform, they're necessarily much less organized (presumably) than an official board. The third party hosting is also an issue because it's far less clear to new users where they should go with questions/issues, because there's no guarantee that on reddit anyone will even see your post/question, whereas boards would have dedicated sections for Tech Issues, Lore Discussion, Patch Notes/Balance Discussion, etc. These are lost on a monolithic subreddit format, though much of the overall purpose is still served.

2369,5e5d314ea3cf97edf5d989f6,Actually idk. I tried to initially play the game with unlock but couldn’t and just decided I didn’t care - after all when I started playing I only played for fun. After awhile of playing like that (a little under a year of playing with locked camera probably maybe like 8 months) I decided I wanted to try and improve at the game in general so at that point unlocked the camera and forced myself to get used to it. But having it locked for so long I’d say helped me at the time because it helped me focus more on the game and just have fun with it as playing unlocked led to a very frustrating experience when I was a noob. I’d say its worth it to play with locked if you are very unfamiliar with this genre of game as you will need to learn a lot about playing the game better and having an unlocked camera will detract from that.,Saying Farewell to Boards - League of Legends,2020-03-01 23:02:27

2398,5e5d3152a3cf97edf5d98a6a,"Riot was founded in 2006 by Ryze and Tryndamere, and Guinsoo and several other nameless developers were involved from the start with what was surely a contract to be paid in equity. Pendragon got involved in September 2008, only a few months before closed beta which started in April 2009. That was once tens of millions in investment capital had already been secured. Tencent was already involved as an investor back then (they made three separate investments in 2008, 2011 and 2015 when they finally became sole owners of Riot Games). There wasn’t much equity left to give, if any.

Considering this, I doubt he had much equity promised, especially with how late into development the game was when he joined. He didn’t take any risk by joining a company who already had secured extremely significant capital investments, why would he have been rewarded with significant equity? They surely had enough capital to offer him a good old salary with MAYBE a fraction of a percent of the company in equity. 

Maybe he made a few millions, but I would bet good money it’s nothing over 7 digits, and even that seems on the high side. Pretty sure it would be something more like 6 digits. Also, he’s not in Ohio, he’s in California, that number isn’t as impressive over there. In the Los Angeles area, you can live comfortably, but you are definitely not mansion rich with 7 digits, you’re homeowner rich. A nice home, sure, but I digress. Nothing that he couldn’t have achieved through smart ad monetization of DotA Allstars, considering the size of the website at the time.

Pendragon is already a name almost no one knows. I might have exagerated when I said he has nothing to show for it, obviously he got money, but I’m sure he would appreciate some non-monetary recognition. 

My main point is that being an asshole by shutting down the Allstars website during the LoL closed beta did not get him any further in life.

You don't really know how this works, do you?

There's something called dilution.

To quote:

> Mr. Laurent and people close to the companies say the buyout solved a brewing problem regarding Riot’s employee compensation. Riot had been awarding stock options to employees since 2008, but there was frustration as Riot’s shares remained illiquid without an initial public offering or outright sale. Tencent also had been reluctant to regularly repurchase Riot shares, as it would hurt the Chinese company’s earnings. By 2015, Riot’s employees held more than 23 million options that, when exercised, would have diluted Tencent’s stake in Riot to 73%.

Tencent paid $1.45 billion for those 27%

> Some Riot employees held options with strike prices as low as 8.2 cents and became millionaires overnight

Don't count on it.  If game developers want to create new games based off mods of WC3 Reforged, they simply have to create new characters and art for their game.  As far as I can tell, Blizz's new policy affects copyrightable works only, which does not include game mechanics (those are the subject of patent rights).  It's one of the reasons why tower defense games are so diverse: noone owns the rights to tower defense as a genre.

If one wanted to profit off a popular game mode made through one of Blizzard's custom game mods (e.g., Direct Strike from SC2 Arcade), one would simply have to change the art of the game such that it doesn't use Blizzard assets or assets that look substantially similar to Blizzard art.",Saying Farewell to Boards - League of Legends,2020-03-02 15:36:50

Stuff that Reddit lacks, its far harder to find particular topics because it lacks anyway way to have defined category sections. Shoot this reddit doesn't even use Flairs so it is quite literally impossible to search something by any sort of same topic or theme. 


Say what you want about the Quality of the Lol Forums, but its sorting and sections are objective far better for discussion because i don't have to scroll past 20 different highlights clips and LCS discussion before i find anything about a gameplay topic or discussion. If i want to find many threads of fanart, i simply go to the fanart category, if i want to see what people are discussion with gameplay, i go to the Gameplay Sections. That is something Reddit lacks.

The old forums used the old bulletin board style of forum, which is antiquated and not as useful as Reddit's form of organizing topics of conversation.

I joined this sub back in Season 3 because I viewed it as being a superior place to have conversations related to League.  I suspect that many of us felt the same way.  Riot's forums lost their popularity not because of a change in format, but because Riot's competition (i.e., Reddit and Discord) provided better services.

And that's fine.  Riot is a game developer, not a news aggregator.  Let Riot do what it does best and let other sites carry the weight of other aspects of the community.

2541,5e5d3163a3cf97edf5d98ca6,"when a company gets created, you may only invest (buy shares) in the company if the company lets you. this means they’re a privately traded company. 

early employees often get compensation in the form of a piece of paper saying, at some point you may purchase shares in our company at $X per share. $X is based off of what the company is worth at that time, in this case as little as $0.08/share. 

over time the company grows in value, as does the value of the shares. the issue is that at a privately traded company you can only sell the shares back to the company, and the company can refuse to buy them. 

employees were getting angry as they had huge amounts of wealth that they didn’t have access to.

2574,5e5d3167a3cf97edf5d98d2a,"To expand on the other guy: (TL<DR at the bottom)

The year is 2016. Solo/Duo Q has been replaced by DynamicQ, where you can enter as any number of people to play. You are a solo player and ooooh boy, are you gonna be in pain in your next ranked: the enemy is a premade team consisting of a 3-man party and 2 duos, all with voicecom against, your team that only has the jungler and the midlaner as duos. You obviously get obliterated to kingdom come because of the difference in organization and coordination.

Well, at least the worst is over. You play a few games, a few duos here and stuff. Nothing big, you tell yourself until you click *search game* for the 5th time this saturday night to play your favorite champion, Lux Midlane... ALAS, the next match has you team up with a 4-man party!

> u/TheDraconianOne you will be top

> But I am mid

> Ok, then we all troll

And so you dodge that match faster than the wind, powerless to change that outcome while those 4 people abuse the system. ""it's nothing big"", you tell yourself as you imagine they would likely flame you and blame you all game since they were 4 people (this is part of the reason 4-man parties aren't allowed in current flex)

---------------------

**TL:DR** Big gap in coordination and organization made matches between 3-4 man parties against solos and duos ended up in very unbalanced game matchups even when, in theory, there was a balanced MMR distribution. 4 man parties allowed themselves to heavy toxic behaviour that ruined the experience of many solo players too. ELOBoosting was at it's highest as people that were silvers or golds could attain higher ranks due to 3-4 man parties and win mainly by having better communication that the enemy team could be lacking",Saying Farewell to Boards - League of Legends,2020-03-02 02:26:52

2820,5e5d318ea3cf97edf5d99105,"Yeah, but I think that it makes Dota more difficult and interesting. I came to the League from Dota and in the beginning it was so frustrating to see skill hitboxes. As well as items CD. And let's be honest - no one plays with ingenious hunter.

It reminds me... I thought that League is more unique cause every champion has it's own passive. Such a fool I was. Really, if you look at them with some more attention, you will see that almost all skills in League are copy-pasted. The unique ones is like mb 20-30 (may be more, but anyway drastically less than 200 what is smaller than half of all skills).

And I never thought about items till I started to build things by myself. League items not rly good, let's be honest. We have: something to deal damage. Something to absorb damage. Something to lifesteal. That's all, with few exceptions like redemption. And look at Thornmail. How many champions can use it's passive (not wounds one) efficient? 3?. I just dream that Rito replace it with Blade Mail from Dota. But it would destroy Assassins as class.... Well, I don't mind (don't be affended, my press-one-two-buttons-to-kill friends, cause damage is magic - you still can null it with items like banshee's veil or edge of night). If we compare League and Dota items, we would find out that there is a lot unique items (in Dota), that can provide us with controll over the game, not just with damage or it's absorbation.  Basher, Satanic, Aeon (okay, it's not rly good example, but I like how it works), Force staff, HEX, Ethereal, DUST, SMOKE - items like this can expand, diversify gameplay. Okay, don't want to add new interesting one? Atleast balance old ones. What does I mean? Why we can simply switch off sunflre cape? What if I need this item, but I don't want to push my wave everytime when I want to kill minion? Why we have items, that are usefull just for about 3 champions like manamune, thornmail?

Honestly? I wouldnt bother with DoTA. it is an *interesting* game. It looks really cool, it has very interesting mechanics. but it has been piling up very inelegant mechanics since DoTA 1, and it added up. turn rates are based on a draconian formula that no one but Icefrog knows, aggro is awfully done, with things like clicking on an enemy on the other of the map drawing aggro to you, and tower aggro being the kind of thing you mostly get a feel of, instead of knowing. Balance is not even a second thought, and champions can have 60-70% winrates while others have 30%, and that's OK. Every time a new problem appears, instead of adjusting the game accordingly, they add new mechanics that come with new problems.        
    
But the biggest problem is... I played like 300 hours of DoTA total, and I don't think I had fun more than 50. I'm serious. most games feel like a slog, pontuated by cool moments. being stuck in a 2 hour game with a team that refuses to win against a team that refuses to lose fucking *sucks*. Feeling like every single game is tag with guns, with whoever gets the first shot winning, *sucks*.     
        
There's a public for that kind of game, and it is *the* perfect game for that public. but you will only find out if you are that public after 200 hours, and I wouldn't sink 200 hours in a game on the offchance I am the very specific kind of person that likes it.

Icefrog just cares a lot about the top end balance (where, just like in LoL, WR is a pretty pointless statistic) and would rather help push the lower end to that point, only balancing around it if it wouldn't harm the top end at all because he understands bad players will eventually get better anyways.

>  There's a reason why the game peaked in 2016, and player count has been declining

IDK, there's multiple reasons to consider including that Valve does a lot of actual ban waves. They recently banned, I think it was 40,000 people, for boosting & toxicity and they were banned for 18 years. They do this a lot.

> It also sucks that half the games you are going to play have a pudge in it, 1/4 are going to have a Slark, 1/4 will have a PA...

Yeah that really isn't a balance issue, Pudge's WR is 51%, PA's WR is 51%, Slark's WR is 49%. People just find those characters really fun. You'd see a similar thing in LoL if the bans weren't guaranteed bans in the pub mode, Yasuo would be a lot higher pick rate for example.

> Looking at a hero, liking it, having a blast with it, only to notice you are getting fucked every game because as fun as your hero is, it has 40% winrate for a reason, fucking sucks.

Honestly across all skill levels combined the games are really similar on win rates.

- Allow teams to chose to get a 5-min pause after a game (there are already some scouting time, but allow the possibility to have a bit more time, especially after a long game)

- Allow teams to pause the game, for a max. duration of 5 minutes, with timer visible, if you are less than 3mn into the game (for AFK/disconnect, whatever). A vote is necessary to unpause the game prior the end of the timer

- Allow teams to vote pause the game for max 5mn, past 3mn into the game. Meaning is that ennemy team have their saying into pausing the game. They can refuse it and you could not blame it for that. But if they are willing to wait, why not?
