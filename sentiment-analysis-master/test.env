Young professionals and those seeking career changes may consider new profession based on sector growth and salary.  In Ontario, there is The Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act, 1996 that makes Ontarioâ€™s public sector more open and accountable to taxpayers. The act requires organizations that receive public funding from the Province of Ontario to make public, by March 31 each year, the names, positions, salaries and total taxable benefits of employees paid $100,000 or more in the previous calendar year.
