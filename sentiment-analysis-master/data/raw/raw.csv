Now I think I understood the game in general (Runes, Items, Phases, Counters, ...) and I fell in love with mid and support, especially Zoe and Pyke/Blitzcrank. Atm I have four different questions:

1. Why is it, that after the laning phase, so many teamfights shift into the jungle? I mean, when there is a drake up or something it kind of makes sense to me. But so many times my team splits up in the jungle and getting f\*cked one by one. Is there a deeper meaning I just don't understand?
2. Are there any hotkeys that are commonly used? By now, I only use hotkeys for active items and skills/summoner spells. I read something about a hotkey for attacking the next enemy and stuff. Is there any ""hidden"" control stuff I should know about?
3. How can you tell (without checking guides and stuff) which stats scale the best with certain champs? For example: Mundo with an AP build is BS. But how do you know that?
4. Is there another way to earn blue essences except leveling up, First win of the day and recycling champion shards? Because that is incredibly slow. It takes forever to unlock a champ."

9,5e385968841d20c9f26158ea,"Any advice on recognizing Aphelios's abililties?

I've been playing league since early 2012 and this is the one champion they've released where I've had continued problems trying to recognize their abilties.

For most champion's kits, I can understand it within a game usually. I either play the champion in a solo custom game or now in practice tool and can grasp what they do pretty quickly.

I remember reading the tooltips for the updated abilities for the Akali and Irelia reworks and being a little bit confiused about how the champion as a whole would play, but as soon as I played it and played against it, it quickly made sense.

When Qiyana was revealed I thought her abilities were confusing until I played just a few minutes as her and it near instantly made sense.

Even for champions that I hadn't bought yet, playing a game against them would usually bring about the champion's typical playstyle and I'd be able to figure out what they're capable of and what their weaknesses are.

Aphelios breaks this pattern for me. I've played against him a handful of times and I still don't know what he does. I understand things like Infernum is the aoe gun and Crescendum is like a boomerang that does a lot of damage and that he also has this weapon that slows you, but my understanding of it really ends there. 

The symbols by the champion are hard to recognize. How do I know which weapon he has in his off-hand? Do I need to just play more and more games against him to associate their very unlear symbols by his health bar with the weapon he's using?"

24,5e385968841d20c9f2615926,"Anyone got thoughts on how gold income works when it's a solo kill vs kill w/ assist? 

Assuming that the kill provides 300 gold, it makes more sense to have a teammate try and assist or even ks to get the extra 150 gold siphoned into the team. 

When I play roles like Jungler, I sometimes get asked why I even try to damage a champion that is going to die. I try explaining that 450 gold is better than 300 gold and that I try to only aim for assists so that the carries will get the 300 portion.

That being said, it seems odd to me to have us be incentivized to get assists for an extra 150 gold while not providing extra gold for those good solo kills. I assume it's to prevent snowballing and to encourage team play (which I am all for), but there should be a nice middle ground for this. Thoughts?"

43,5e385969841d20c9f2615972,"The meta changes way more often than in Overwatch. Our own version of Goats was nerfed into the ground after like 2 months for example, therefore it’s hard to talk about a character that’s been consistently viable. The final blow thing you read refers to minion kills. If you dont “last hit” them, you only get xp points , but no gold. With kills on other players. you get more gold for getting the kill, but there is still assist gold. Certain items are good on certain champions, as each of them has scalings on his abilities that scale with a certain type of damage (ad or ap), and also certain item special passives or actives synergize with a champions kit. However, there is still room for personal preference and adaptation to the enemy team. For starters, I reccomend websites such as u.gg for items until you figure out how they work. There are teamcomps such as dive or deathball, but due to the massive amount of champions (150) they are not limited to a certain character and can be played with many interchangeable champions"
44,5e38596a841d20c9f2615976,"I can't say I understand everything in this comment, such as deathball, so I'm gonna reply to what I get here. Feel free to clarify on everything else.

> If you get the final blow, you get gold, but if you don't you get no reward at all?

You get assist gold, but not the bonus bounty from last-hitting an enemy who had bounty. Assists are granted within helping kill an enemy within the last 10 seconds, and assist gold is split between how many champions helped kill (usually 150g in total, then split, unless the enemy is feeding.)

> Are there items that are good for certain comps or champs?

Well, yes, there's items such as thornmail which is good against AD champions that primarily auto-attack, and it's good on someone like Rammus who has a taunt that forces the enemy to auto-attack him. Useful against high AD auto champions like Master Yi and Draven because they practically kill themselves. There's magic resist items for magic-damage champions, armor for attack-damage champions, and health for (most...) true damage champions. Certain champions prefer other items, but generally items are fairly diverse, and most if not all AP champions enjoy Morellonomicon for example. There are also support-specific items that help champions that heal/shield allies such as ardent censor, redemption, etc if you prefer to support and peel others off the carries.

As for your first question, I can't say I completely get it but most of the roles have been consistent in the sense they're played and meta year-round, but sometimes things sneak in such as mages being played bot, in place of the ADC (the marksman/attack damage carry that goes botlane with the Support) position, because of what some mages can provide, such as Syndra."
45,5e38596a841d20c9f261597a,"Your first mistake is assuming that Overwatch and League are on the same level in approach. The two have completely different mindsets. Given how technical League is and the mental of much of its player base, people rarely build for the team composition and instead focus on champs they’re mechanically good with (think the guy that can only play hanzo and refuses to swap). Team composition in League is much more focused around maximizing the potential of the random 5 champs you have rather than always building a team of 5 to specifically synergize with one another, especially since a large portion of the game is played with each individual team member mostly being on their own for some time. You certainly can try to build a synergistic team comp, but since learning to play a champ well takes more time than it does in OW, building a pool to choose from is more difficult. That said, tanks and supports typically have the most success playing with larger pools rather than sticking to one specifically.

Peeling and creating space is a tank (top) or caster support role. Sort champions by tank or support and you’ll see a good spread of options you can look at to see what works best for you. Since mobility is way more valuable in this game than OW, most tanks and peel champions are slower (no ball here).

Kills (the person who strikes the final blow) award kill gold, and assist gold is distributed to anyone who helped. Assists can be as involved as doing 90% of the damage or as simple as healing one involved party member before the fight. The gold is less, but still significant. The larger victory of a kill is removing an enemy from play for an extended period of time, since League has death timers that increase as the game goes on.

There are specific team “comps” where champions’ kits all align to a specific goal. “Dives” in our case are teams with large amount of engage, mobility, and cc, paired with burst damage to quickly kill enemies. “Deathballs” are typically just your large tanks peeling for your smaller damage dealers (carries as we call them).

Happy to answer any other questions. If you let me know what heroes in OW you play I’d be happy to recommend you some similar champs."
46,5e38596a841d20c9f261597e,"Generally its just by knowing the champions I think. You can look up each champion and just see their source of damage, the fandom wiki shows each champions typical adaptive force type at the top next to their portrait [like so](https://i.imgur.com/cqeMiGS.png) then it just comes down to memory. Death recap also shows which damage type they did so you can gauge it based off of that especially since you're playing ARAM."
47,5e38596a841d20c9f2615982,"In game, always have a look if one enemy is extremely fed. If yes, build against the damage type of that champion.  

Also take a look in the death recap, it shows you what type of damage you took when you died."
48,5e38596a841d20c9f2615986,You should make yourself a cheat sheet. The best way is to just learn who builds what. You’ll always need that knowledge moving forward
49,5e38596a841d20c9f261598a,"1) unexperienced players, often someone gets caught and people try to safe the situation and only get dragged into a bad fight themselves, dont expect that to change tho, i was in the top 5% of the playerbase and its nothing different, just try to make the best of it.

2) shift + qwer levels up that respective skill, alt + qwer is selfcast if the ability can do that, like if you press alt + e on janna you shield yourself no matter where your cursor is. You can look up all controls in the settings of league tho.

3) you cant, league is a complex game and many champs have different builds and can shift from one playstyle to another. For example shaco can go ap/ad or hybrid. Nautilus was played tank for years and suddeny people started playing him full ap. Itemization is dependend on meta and game state, you need to look up what is best in this meta, no way around that.

4) no, the ways you described are the only ones and the new system is better in terms of gains than the old system. Getting champs was way harder when i began to play around season2, so you just need to play more or buy champs with rp."
50,5e38596a841d20c9f261598e,"1. It varies, especially with elos, in lower ones they see the enemy in some lane and wanna kill him then get surprised eith others in jg, then someone wants to help but cant get in time but commits(big mistake most of the times) and then it continues on and on. In Higher elos there are a nubmer of reasons but most common is setting up vision for an objective that will be contested later on (baron drake etc), or for example when one jungler is ahead and predicts the other will be clearing this or that camp he goes to disrupt/get the kill/ get the camp.

2. Honestly dont know about the attack hotkey but the important ones are f2-f5 which swotch the map view to your teammates (in the order they appear above your minimap) i changed the hotkeys here a bit and they go:
I put the summoners on MB4 and MB5 (mouse side buttons)
Active items i ussually only have 2 max 3(rarely) and i put them on S,  D and F
Abd i put the teammate view switcg on numbers

3. You will be able to know kinda intuitively when get to that point, but for most champs you will already learn through playing before you get to the point of intuition. If you are new i would suggesz to focus on roles you play, as you said mid and supp and learn through guides and videos the most common champs. Then evolve the knowledge from there. Most important thing there is the ap/ad ratio of the champs abilities, primarily the ability he relies upon the most.

2. Shit+qwer for lvl up. Alt+qwer for self cast.

3. Reading the ratio of a champion give you a general direction, but mostly it come down to experience. Or just plain math if you have time to do it.

4. Do the missions when they're available. For example atm the watch esport missions give you 1000 BE for watching 6 games of competitive play. Outside of missions there is no way to accelerate your BE gains except playing more."

54,5e38596a841d20c9f261599e,"At the moment, Riot needs to add some clarity for Aphelios' off-hand weapon and which weapon his ultimate is casting. The symbol by the HP bar is only his main-hand weapon, and they're colour coded as well as shaped like what they do (Infernum is a blue flame, for example, and Gravitum is a purple orb.)

There's a slight tint in his ultimate for which effect it's casting, but it isnt very visible unless you pay attention to it. His off-hand is also shown on his back of his model while his main-hand is in his hand with a unique stance. So far this is the only way you can tell, until or if it gets updated, which I wouldn't be surprised seeing the most recent pro game.

As for his guns, the hotlinks are the icons for each gun so you know what they are next to his HP bar:

**[Calibrum](https://i.imgur.com/KhTQzmJ.png) - Sniper Rifle - Green:** Gains range. 

**Q:** Shoots a projectile that will mark you if hit and then allows him to auto you for extra damage and proc his off-hand weapon (Current ""global"" if marked, but being nerfed to 2000.)

-

**[Severum](https://i.imgur.com/mD6YtpR.png) - Scythe Pistol - Red:** Heals for % of damage dealt, excess healing functions like Overheal and becomes a shield lasting for 30 seconds. 

**Q:** Gains movement speed and rapidly attacks using main and offhand weapon for a few seconds, dealing damage and can crit. He cannot auto during this animation.

-

**[Gravitum](https://i.imgur.com/C5PaKTe.png) - Gravity Cannon - Purple:** Autos apply a decaying slow. 

**Q:** Anyone effected by the slow is damaged and will be rooted for 1 second.

-

**[Infernum](https://i.imgur.com/NCZQ5f5.png) - Flamethrower - Blue:** Attacks are AOE and deal 110% AD damage and 75-100% to secondary targets, reduced vs minions. Crits fire more bolts and deal bonus damage. 

**Q:** Sprays a cone dealing damage then throws out a volley of his off-hand weapon at each enemy hit by the cone. Applies on-hit.

-

**[Crescendum](https://i.imgur.com/bxmgdHj.png) - Chakram - White:** Autos are a chakram and he can't auto until it returns to him, the closer you are to him the faster the chakram attacks because of the return rate. Using an ability that would require him to throw the chakram throws a spectral one instead and he can catch it and increase the amount of chakrams he has (up to 20, lasts 5 seconds.) Autos with the chakram are empowered and do more damage based on number of chakrams and the bonus damage can crit. 

**Q:** Places a turret that applies his off-hand weapon, scales off his ad crit and attack speed. Akin to a Zyra plant (deactivates when not attacking, then will die out after a few seconds. Refreshes if you walk into it before it dies, will shoot for a limited amount of time until it dies. *NOT* like Heimer where it will revive when he walks near it and remain until killed)"

Enemy team hard lost every lane (that was not a ranked game), and I thought ""I'd forfeit, they don't deserve such a lose, but other teammates won't vote for it anyway"". Then boom, and suddenly someone typed /ff and there's 3 For 1 Against."
57,5e38596a841d20c9f26159aa,"Malzahar and cassiopeia come to mind.

Both have good waveclear. Malz can ult them to make them stand still and cassio has worked ground.

Cassio vs yasuo is a skill matchup tho, as he can block your dmg with windwall, so it depends how you both play the lane."
58,5e38596a841d20c9f26159ae,Point and click “fuck you”s like Ryze root and Kassadin silence tend to help handle mobile midlaners. Lissandra and Xerath also have really reliable cc against champs that want to get close to you like your melee assassins. Xerath is an especially hard counter to Yas since his main source of damage bypasses windwall and he can stay almost completely out of tornado range if he plays back
59,5e38596b841d20c9f26159b2,Garen can counter yas mid
60,5e38596b841d20c9f26159b6,"Wave management is a skill you have to practice. SoloRenektonOnly did an excellent guide series on wave management (youtube) that while old is still completely relevant.

Midlane is a malleable lane that changes based on who you’re playing. Mages want to focus more on farm and scaling while assassins should prioritize roaming and helping the jungler make plays. You should always try to help your jungler when you can though, as you’re typically the closest to him a lot of times."
61,5e38596b841d20c9f26159ba,Just go to youtube there is a lot of tutorials on midlane and certain champions. Also you have on Lol ProGuides youtube channel a lot of videos on wave management so you van get an idea when to push and when to freeze and you can just look more up on Youtube since there is dozens of it. Best way to learn is just look ar proplayers and streamers and try to copy how they play what they do and do the same ofc it's easier said than done but you should try to copy them and use it in ir games you'll eventually see yourself becoming better.
62,5e38596b841d20c9f26159be,"If you are good at skillshots, try Xerath. He is a strong poke champion and has crazy scaling damage. You could try him on support before trying him in mid.

Tips I would recommend is:

- Know when you are strong and weak against your opponent. Also be cognizant on the level 2 advantage.

- Ward, ward, ward. You will save yourself multiple times just from warding. Buy pink wards as well, the 75 gold investment is almost always worth it.

- Others gave good advice on how to learn wave management. I would also emphasize to learn when to gank a side lane vs push the tower."

Mage: Lux
Assassin: Talon
Marksman: Ashe

All very straightforward simplistic starting champions. Most of them are inexpensive to get as well"
78,5e38596c841d20c9f26159fe,"First off, welcome to League!

I'll give you some of my personal opinions and will include at the end my choice for easiest  champion and easy champion that could play every role. To give you an understanding of my personal knowledge of the game I can say that at my peek I was Platinum 2, but quit during my climb due to personal reasons. 

There are a lot of more basic/good starting champions. Some for each role would include:


Top- Garen, Renekton, Dr. Mundo, Cho'Gath, and Teemo.


Jungle- Amumu, Master Yi, Xin Zhao, and Nunu.


Mid- Annie, Malzahar, Ryze (kinda), and if you are a skillshot master then try Xerath (I used him to climb rank a lot during the low elos, but he is VERY skillshot  intensive).


ADC- Miss Fortune, Sivir, Ashe, Tristana, and Ezreal (though Ezreal is harder as he is skillshot-based, but if you learn him he is one of the safest ADCs).


Support- Leona, Yuumi (easiest champion in the game imo), Soraka (kinda beginner friendly), and Braum (though he is an easy to learn, hard to master champion).

Easiest champion (in my opinion)- Yuumi. You literally sit on your ADC and do some skills, but don't have as much pressure of moving alone.

Easy champion that can play all roles- Teemo. While it is a running meme that Teemo is evil, Teemo is versatile enough to be able to play any role.

Hope this helps and if you have questions, feel free to message me or add me on LoL, IGN: Egolith."

90,5e38596c841d20c9f2615a2e,"Hey, thanks for the fast response.
I have something to add to your answers:
2) When I have a shield spell it automatically uses it on myself if I don't target an ally. Isn't that the same? Only issue I can see is if my cursor is somehow over an ally and I want to use the spell on myself (which didn't happen until now, but I can see the risk of it)

4) My account was created in the early states of the game. I played a couple games back then. Wasn't the old system that you gain points after every match which you can invest in new heroes? Why is that worse than only getting points on a level up? 

And another thing about the keybinds:
I tried to bind ""Enemy has vision here"" on I think it was alt+leftclick or ctrl+leftclick. But somehow the game always resets that option as soon as I join a match. Why?"
91,5e38596c841d20c9f2615a32,Thanks for the fast response. 1) makes sense to me! I didn't think about that. 2) Can you give me a few examples for when it is important as zoe to switch my camera to my top/bot lane for example? I always try to focus on my surroundings (which is already hard for me - there is so much stuff I have to think about as a beginner). I already extended my minimap size in a config file so I have a better general overview of what is going on (for roaming or not getting ganked)
92,5e38596c841d20c9f2615a36,"^ This video for sure helps. Also if you aren't using quickcast yet, start using it. It saves you precious milliseconds that could be the difference between life or death in a fight."
93,5e38596d841d20c9f2615a3a,"Oh nice. I have a small question right away:

How am I supposed to not steal all the kills from my adc with ult? :)

Or when is it ok to finish off enemies when there is the opportunity? My friend (adc) always gets mad when I kill 2 or more people in a fight with ult. I understand why he gets mad. My job is to help my adc get strong (correct me if I'm wrong) but there is not much I can do in a fight except hooking and stunning a target with Q and E in order to not finish off targets ""by accident"""
94,5e38596d841d20c9f2615a3e,"You sure about that one, riot cant really enforce this as using the forfeit option can never be banable and if the whole team agrees that the game isnt winable they can rightfully forfeit.

Riot cant just say you needed to win this game, you cant forfeit here, as it sets a precedent case that is not really handleable from riots side."

101,5e38596d841d20c9f2615a5a,"I thought it was the lane you don't play around. Like if you're jungler plays around top lane and your mid roams top more, then bot is weak side. Which can go along with your explanation bevUse you want to gank your stronger lane early and get them rolling while your weak side chills until late game"
102,5e38596d841d20c9f2615a5e,That's incredibly stupid
103,5e38596d841d20c9f2615a62,If you're playing a lvl 3 jungler you are literally out of the game before it even started. And how hard is it to *not* last hit a buff as an adc?
104,5e38596d841d20c9f2615a66,"I don't give two fucks about the buff effect and the gold income. Missing the first buff sets you *massively* behind on exp, sustain, and jungler schedule.

If the enemy jungler sees your adc has a buff you can kiss your second buff goodbye with zero counterplay.

Don't even think about contesting any of the crabs, you're two levels behind and no buffs.

Seems like you've never played jungle at all.

It's like someone would get your first 3 waves of minion exp and gold income. And then fucks off to another lane. ""Just recover""."
105,5e38596d841d20c9f2615a6a,"Yeah, the league definately isnt an easy game to learn, so dont get discouraged if you have difficulty remembering the macro side.
One of the first things i starzed paying attention to is your teammates hp bar above the minimap. If they are low or lowering i look at the minimap to see their position in lane(who is pushing who) then if the enemies are the ones extending to our side of the lane i switch camera to determine if i can gank or not. Thats my primary task for camera switch, better players probably have more cases. Other one is if you start playing champs with global ults(draven, ezreal, jinx, senna, gangplank, soraka) or semi-global (xerath, galio, ziggs) then you need the info on enemy champs health which you get by fast camera switch when you see your teammates are in fights.
One important thing, in 99% of the cases you need to push in your wave before roaming to gank/help (also known as geting prio) by clearing the enemy minions in your lane. That will force your opponent to deal with your minions and you get to the other place first, or he loses an entire wave which is extremly valuable to you cazse you create gold diff in your lane. Dont do that obly when a fight is in a jg near you and your teammate will die if you dont get there immideatly."
106,5e38596d841d20c9f2615a6e,Anyone who get mad at you for executing people with pyke ult need to learn to read. 2 people getting full kill gold is better than 1. And regardless it's better to secure a kill for you than no one getting it.
107,5e38596d841d20c9f2615a72,"You need to explain to your friend that the goal of the game is not to have as much kills as you can, but to get to their nexus. The math is really simple, when you execute with your ult he gets the same amount of money as you, so the amount of gold given for the same kill is DOUBLED. You as supp get lower income from the start and this is the thing what keeps you afloat cause pyke isnt a utility support but a roamer and assasin. 
Second thing is that when enemys hp is below threshold you -execute- him, meaning the dmg is true and not physical. If your friend wants to play for kills you need a different support, my reccomendation is blitz naut or thresh because they cc  and disrupt enemies for a longer time.

Also very important thing that adcs often forget, when you hook someone its not an immediate ""LEAVE EVERYTHING AND ALL IN"". your hook is excellent as poke as well. The all in happenes when you hook and then stun cause it puts you in the middle of your oppobents.

One more thing i hope you know but i see alot of players do wrong is the escape with pyke. You always always want to E first and then W. If you need to flash always E then W then immediately flash, cause you will go out of their sight and they cant put in one more autoattack or slow ability."
108,5e38596d841d20c9f2615a76,"They can, cuz intentionally lowering mmr to stomp games is just as not okay as buying elo boost to raise it"

What role/s do you like?"
114,5e38596e841d20c9f2615a8e,"Certainly, yes. I'd say for top lane I'd go with Warwick or Xin Zhao fighter/tank type of champions and you won't have much ptoblem mastering them. For ADC I'd go Caitlyn or Sivir. Pretty basic champions but effective since Cait has huge range and CC as well. For Sivir she has a good wave clear and a spellshield to block her from any spells like Thresh/Blitz hook or even ultimates. For Support I'd go with Alistar or Leona also easy to use champions. 

Also for now I wouldn't focus on mid lane or jungle since they are hard without too much game knowledge since in mid you can be ganked like from every angle and a against a good midlaner it can be discouraging.

For the champions just look up at youtube how people play them to learn from it and just try to copy them or just pratice the champion you wanna use in the Practice Tool. 

For build and masteries just go to OP.GG look for the champion you wanna play and look at how many times it has been played by a fellow Summoner and just copy it's build, I'd look at a high elo player since there is a reason why he uses that build amd it just works. No need to go for a fantasy build or plays just get the fundamentals right and then you can play or build some random shit like the pro players."
115,5e38596e841d20c9f2615a92,"Right, it’s bascially the lane you don’t prioritize because you know they won’t perform as well as the other side"
116,5e38596e841d20c9f2615a96,"you’re right the adc/supp shouldn’t be hitting anywhere close to that low of HP. Next time try telling the adc/supp to leave when buffs around ~700 HP 
Although I have found myself behind in lvls I still found ways to stay relevant (ganking, burning summs, just overall helping the lane win)"
117,5e38596e841d20c9f2615a9a,Lol people get three buffed all the time and still recover and win the game. In this case your team still got the gold and you're complaining. Sounds like a tilt issue.
118,5e38596e841d20c9f2615a9e,"Well given your mental goes straight out the window when it happens, I understand why you always get destroyed when it does.

I play earlygame fighter junglers. If I lose first buff I typically grab a single camp and move for my second, or beeline it if my jungler is also an early jungler. If it’s not, I typically kill them if they try, and if it is I can typically still fight them or I might just use the fact that I know exactly where they are and what they’re doing to go cheese a level 2 elsewhere or take their camps (because they can only be in one place at a time). 

If they’re on your camps they can’t be on their own, so you can just go lateral or path elsewhere and still be pretty close to par. You can also camp the guy who took your buff, since they’re naturally going to be a stronger gank.

You have options but you’re so caught up in griefing you don’t even want to try. So of course you get obliterated."
119,5e38596e841d20c9f2615aa2,"Maybe he is not aware of the fact that he gets full credit for the kill. I will talk with him about that. He never played pyke before and had a long break.
How do I escape if I don't have E and/or flash up?"
120,5e38596e841d20c9f2615aa6,Thanks I’ll give it a shot.

123,5e38596e841d20c9f2615ab2,"? Your adc getting your buff is way worse for you. you have to solo your second buff with no leash, level 1, with a buffed level 2 jungler invading you. There is *no* chance of you getting that second buff.

Three buffing you get a little behind but it's not *the* worst."

This alone show you're talking out of your ass. ""Yeah I typically 1v1 a buffed jungler that is a level up on me when levels are the most critical in the game""."
125,5e38596e841d20c9f2615aba,"Yea, tell him to see pyke R, he doesnt get the kill but gets full amount of gold.

Only option is w wich gives you movement boost and you can hope to get out of sight(circle aroznd you when you are under W) before they kill you. Rarely there is an outplay people forget about. When your ult hits an enemy you blink to that location. If you killed an enemy with ult you can recast it. So what i sometimes do if possible is i try to hit a minion with second cast but with an end of my ult hitbox, so i blink to that position which is away from the enemies and then i go W"
126,5e38596e841d20c9f2615abe,Annie is a fantastic first champion yep. I used to play a lot of support but I've moved to ADC recently. Experimenting with some jungle as well. I'm not fantastic by any means lol high silver / low gold but I should be able to give you some tips still
127,5e38596f841d20c9f2615ac2,"...a single camp gets you to 2. Are you suggesting this enemy jg cleared an entire side of their jungle and got to my second buff before I did?
If they rush my buff they’re 2 and I’m 2, and if they clear for 3 and walk in I have enough camps to still reliably get to 3 by the time they come in.

Maybe stop making excuses and learn your lane."
128,5e38596f841d20c9f2615ac6,So you mean you use your Ult to teleport as far away as possible after a kill? Is there any possibility to cancel my W early except using another ability?
129,5e38596f841d20c9f2615aca,"> If they rush my buff they’re 2 and I’m 2

So they were just masturbating waiting for you to do your camp? Probably they wanted to keep it fair?

> Maybe stop making excuses and learn your lane.

I learned it, it involves my adc not last hitting my buff."
130,5e38596f841d20c9f2615ace,"Yea, its tricky and rarely available cause you only blink if you hit something with your hitbox.

I think pressing w again does the trick, not sure cause you generaly never want to stop it early if youre not attacking something"
131,5e38596f841d20c9f2615ad2,"Dude you’re about as toxic as you are oblivious. Good luck, maybe spend the smite next time."
132,5e38596f841d20c9f2615ad6,"No but I'm serious though. Talk me through how you are level 2 at the same time as the enemy jungler. Like, show me I'm wrong.

> Good luck, maybe spend the smite next time.

Another excellent advice. ""Next time waste your resource""."

546,5e385991841d20c9f2616150,"“Hold on, I don’t wanna enter the fight at this angle.”

Edit: Angle, not angel"
547,5e385991841d20c9f2616154,My God didn't notice until I read this comment
548,5e385991841d20c9f2616158,ikr xD

550,5e385991841d20c9f2616160,cursed server :(
551,5e385991841d20c9f2616164,Wildest thing in Garena is that diamonds still play like NA silvers
552,5e385991841d20c9f2616168,Ad ahri isn't a joke and can deal more DMG than ap Ahri. Though I hate the idea of it
553,5e385991841d20c9f261616c,thanks! i think aatrox pulled a 5head move right there
554,5e385991841d20c9f2616170,"he needed to do the bigbrain flank. if he went straight in, i think i wouldn't have gotten the penta."
555,5e385991841d20c9f2616174,"Aatrox had probably seen the 4 people sieging turret and wanted to tp onto the ward when Nocturne popped ult. My guess is he was spamming his tp summoner while afk walking to the lane, that's why Aatrox tp's a second or two after nocturne ult ends."
556,5e385992841d20c9f2616178,"You see Ivan

When you use Teleporter for ward nearby 

Enemy think you're going away

When you're going closeby

So youo can get the element of surprise again!"
557,5e385992841d20c9f261617c,He has TP on F and Flash on D. I guess he fucked up in champ select and consequently fucked up at that fight.
558,5e385992841d20c9f2616180,"what do you mean ""almost""?"
559,5e385992841d20c9f2616184,true
560,5e385992841d20c9f2616188,a regular day in silver elo on Garena Singapore server...
561,5e385992841d20c9f261618c,"Oi dont disrespect my 5head ad ahri, shit good against melees"
562,5e385992841d20c9f2616190,assturd\*
563,5e385992841d20c9f2616194,"I mean, there's a guy who made Masters with AD Ahri, or was it grandmasters? Challenger? I forget. Fairly high elo. Definitely not a bad build."
564,5e385992841d20c9f2616198,"Ad ahri is annoying, has good mobility and is good agaisnt melees top. Granted I know there are better champs, but me and my boy ezreal call this picks Technologies."
565,5e385992841d20c9f261619c,"yes, it was AD Ahri top"
566,5e385992841d20c9f26161a0,glad you enjoyed it!
567,5e385992841d20c9f26161a4,Milk is the best wingman apparently damn
568,5e385992841d20c9f26161a8,thanks for upvoting!
569,5e385992841d20c9f26161ac,thank you :D
570,5e385992841d20c9f26161b0,silver-gold i think
571,5e385992841d20c9f26161b4,WHO U????
572,5e385992841d20c9f26161b8,"Im his friend, i literally tried to lure her in lmao"
573,5e385992841d20c9f26161bc,that would be insane
574,5e385993841d20c9f26161c0,GAMER MOMENT
575,5e385993841d20c9f26161c4,"""Wow, this team is gonna be heavy. Better go shop."""
576,5e385993841d20c9f26161c8,"If you look at the minimap, I actually canceled the recall and start pushing the turret. I also managed to destroy the turret :D"
577,5e385993841d20c9f26161cc,It's been a while since Ezreal's R doesnt decrease damage for each unit it pass through.
578,5e385993841d20c9f26161d0,"No one actually noticed the play besides me, aatrox and my friend (the AD ahri top lmao). I literally jumped out from my chair when the ult actually hit and kill Riven."
579,5e385993841d20c9f26161d4,Yeah it would be super impressive if Jax got a cross-map shot to secure a Penta.
580,5e385993841d20c9f26161d8,He didn't want to scare off that bird so that ez could get a chance for penta.. a teammate we all need
581,5e385993841d20c9f26161dc,Better to enter the fight at this demon
582,5e385993841d20c9f26161e0,"""I can be your angle….or yuor devil"""
583,5e385993841d20c9f26161e4,This is actually what BB did in last year's spring finals lol
584,5e385993841d20c9f26161e8,Congrats on the penta btw
585,5e385993841d20c9f26161ec,NA silvers are like iron EUW
586,5e385993841d20c9f26161f0,AD can often out damage AP builds for a lot of mages. Especially burst AP mages. The burst is shitty till you get a few items but the sustained damage is rly good. AD annie does more damage than AP in a longer fight.
587,5e385993841d20c9f26161f4,"yeah that sounds accurate.......  


Aatrox is innocent guys, stop bullying him xD"
588,5e385993841d20c9f26161f8,Nice try Aatrox
589,5e385993841d20c9f26161fc,"nah then he wouldn't have TPed down lane, unless he was trying to flash into bot alcove ;-;"
590,5e385993841d20c9f2616200,he didnt get the penta
591,5e385994841d20c9f2616204,Eyy garena sg nice to see one of us on here finally
592,5e385994841d20c9f2616208,"I mean there's a grandmaster jungle Taric. Just because one or two people can make it work, doesn't  mean it's good for 99% of the rest of the world lmao."
593,5e385994841d20c9f261620c,I think it’s probably not great in silver though.
594,5e385994841d20c9f2616210,IT'S THE KID
595,5e385994841d20c9f2616214,I WAS AHRI
596,5e385994841d20c9f2616218,"I know you did, but it is still funny to think that the first thing that comes to your mind after a quadra is to go heal/buy"
597,5e385994841d20c9f261621c,wasn't he already visible tho? like came out of the bush?
598,5e385994841d20c9f2616220,"Your*

Dont worry bro i got you!"
599,5e385994841d20c9f2616224,Took me 4 replays to figure out where the Aatrox went
600,5e385994841d20c9f2616228,it's their lategame play every time they struggle lol
601,5e385994841d20c9f261622c,"I'll take ""lies EUW pretends to believe"" for 500, Alex."
602,5e385994841d20c9f2616230,"Yeah, but NA is better at monetizing our silver than EUW is with iron"
603,5e385994841d20c9f2616234,"I remember when Annie had fucking insane AA range, something to the point where IIRC only cait and late game trist outranged her."
604,5e385994841d20c9f2616238,Yes he did
605,5e385994841d20c9f261623c,"Thats exactly why it works tho lmao. On higher tiers i guarantee you Id get blasted for using ad Ahri top, but since this is silver-gold level, it works amazing, cause they dont know how to punish it."
606,5e385994841d20c9f2616240,"no way, i think u got confused. I was literally in voice call with my buddy who's playing ahri lol"
607,5e385994841d20c9f2616244,"No you werent, bruh, cmon y the identity theft"
608,5e385995841d20c9f2616248,"He was, but since he started channeling tp.. azir wouldn't have to worry about him for a few seconds [or more if he doesn't look at the minimap xD]"
609,5e385995841d20c9f261624c,You have a 1/3rd if the players of EUW so a silver player in NA is more likely to be iron/low bronze in EUW. It’s really simple maths
610,5e385995841d20c9f2616250,She still does but her base attack speed is awful. The AS scaling is probably awful too. Higher AA range doesnt mean much when most other mages outrange you with their abilities and your AA takes so long to go through.
611,5e385995841d20c9f2616254,It's back to 625
612,5e385995841d20c9f2616258,FUCK YOU WERENT THE ONE
613,5e385995841d20c9f261625c,An ez on my team a while ago had a very similar play aight
614,5e385995841d20c9f2616260,"Mhmm, ok i can see that. Except the minimap part, he was right in front of him xD no need to check the map to see."
615,5e385995841d20c9f2616264,but you didn’t do any math
616,5e385995841d20c9f2616268,That really only affects the higher tiers. Na and EU silver are relatively even
617,5e385995841d20c9f261626c,yeah I think it was only removed since annie support was huge at the time. just took a fat minute to get it back
618,5e385995841d20c9f2616270,XD
619,5e385995841d20c9f2616274,No to look at the map to see where he's going to tp
620,5e3859da841d20c9f2616279,Ok this is gonna be a classic really fast

623,5e3859da841d20c9f2616285,Legit probably the first champion that I've been super confused by.
624,5e3859da841d20c9f2616289,I honestly have no clue if thats a glitch or mechanics
625,5e3859da841d20c9f261628d,"1693 dmg in 1.1 sec  


lvl 14 vs lvl 14  


hmm...  


Also, what the fuck happened to Rush's hair."
626,5e3859da841d20c9f2616291,I've been playing this game for many years...but every aphelios play on Reddit I see I have to look at the comments to understand a shred of what's happening.... CertainlyT thank you
627,5e3859db841d20c9f2616295,"Hmmm yes I see

We have decided to nerf jungle xp and top lane relevancy"
628,5e3859db841d20c9f2616299,"I used to ban whatever is considered op in the meta, Aphelios broke that pattern, gonna ban that shit forever probably."
629,5e3859db841d20c9f261629d,"The champ is so hilariously pathetic to watch, to play with or against. It seems like a champ escaped from a random rpg, that has absolutely no place to exist in league. Should just be removed from the game."
630,5e3859db841d20c9f26162a1,at the start of the video i knew what guns he had but still got confused later when he didnt change anything
631,5e3859db841d20c9f26162a5,Ok but like what actually is the counterplay to shit like this? Riot keeps making these super complicated champions but it seems like they put way more burden on the opponents knowing what to do instead of the person playing said champion.
632,5e3859db841d20c9f26162a9,"I think I speak for many when I look at an Aphelios play and declare ""WTF?"""
633,5e3859db841d20c9f26162ad,be careful there will be some guy coming out to defend aphelios by saying its because rush is a noob in low elo thats why he dont understand what aphelios does
634,5e3859db841d20c9f26162b1,Legit reaction at the end.
635,5e3859db841d20c9f26162b5,This is the first champion that made me question if his kit is so obscure or I am just getting too old for this game.
636,5e3859db841d20c9f26162b9,"To me is crazy that he can move while auto attacking, move super fast and have high damage. The range is also stupid."
637,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162bd,Can Riot admit a mistake for once and just delete this guy.
638,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162c1,i mean its a fed ad carry so him winning the 1v1s is fine but the visuals the clarity the fucking no idea anybody has about what he just did is pathetic for a company like riot.
639,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162c5,That’s not league... that is just a new Path of Exile build.
640,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162c9,can we just finally accept aphelios isnt the mechanicly intense champ they hyped him up to be and hes just balance and game clarity wise a clusterfuck?
641,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162cd,"I was watching this game. That aphelios was actually mechanically good on the champion.

He has the red lifesteal item with low ammo  and the shuriken item, he goes in with red weapon Q to stack up shurikens. He then gets the sniper weapon in place of the red and places sniper turrets that mark enemies and hits them with shurikens. He kept doing that combo throughout the game.

200 year memes aside, I think from design point of view the champion is fine, might still use some number tweaks. But from visual and clarity point of view this champion is a nightmare."
642,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162d1,I can’t stop laughing this is gold
643,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162d5,"I really want Riot to make his turret more visually clear. I can understand most of the things going on with Aphelios even if it's chaotic, but it's almost impossible to tell when you're getting marked and how frequently it's happening with the turret/sniper combo in particular. Really frustrating."
644,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162d9,"Okay I know it's aphelios is all, but Holy fuck that dude played that whole situation SO well"
645,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162dd,"The more champions League releases, the more I'm convinced my 9 year old nephew is secretly on the balance team."
646,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162e1,Crescendum still not nerfed good job Rito.
647,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162e5,Riot balance kekw
648,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162e9,"Mechanically advanced champ passes its burden onto the players forced to fight him.   

When we throw away 2020 can we group Aphelios with it?"
649,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162ed,"So he dished out 1600 damage in 1.1 seconds including the death mark I-frames... What in tarnation is happening in the second engage?  Thresh loses 1k health in 1 turret shot and an auto or something? Then what happens to senna? Looks like the turret shoots, Q, auto, then he gets a second 1100 range auto somehow?

Why can he auto her again? Why do 2 autos and an ability kill an ADC through heal? What on earth does this champion do?"
650,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162f1,"Memes aside, that guy is actually good with the champion."
651,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162f5,No one knows how he works because they gave him an owners manual that you have to read first when you buy him.
652,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162f9,I know aphelios is overpowered right now but that dude played it really well and it was a mistake by rush to go in when he had stacked so many chakrams
653,5e3859dc841d20c9f26162fd,"I'll tell you what that is Rush, that's CertainlyT in all his glory."
654,5e3859dd841d20c9f2616301,mirror pleaseeeee
655,5e3859dd841d20c9f2616305,Can someone explain to me how he builds so man boomerang things? Still confused about that.
656,5e3859dd841d20c9f2616309,"Its very simple to see what is happening lol, they get autod by sniper tower"
657,5e3859dd841d20c9f261630d,"If you guys are gonna complain about this character being too hard to understand, just watch sneakys video or take the champ into practice tool. 

Is the champ hard to understand? Yes kinda, but instead of wasting time on complaining on reddit, spend the same ammt time watching a basics video so youll understand. Aphs less complicated than youre making it seem"
658,5e3859dd841d20c9f2616311,His reaction at the end pretty much sums up the entire LoL community feelings about this brilliant champion
659,5e3859dd841d20c9f2616315,"Actually, the Aphelios in this clip played very good, while the other guys on Rush team played really poorly. 

If you want to know what happend : Aphelios stacked his Crescendum's (white) chakrams with his ult, Rush then proceeded to ult this stacked Aphelios with his ult while his Q was on CD, thus dying in the process. (on a side note : Aphelios with Crescendum is really hard for assassins because he can DPS them really fast when in close range, so unless your have all your CDs up as an assassin, don't jump on him). 

Then, Aphelios proceeded to use his Severum's (red) Q to kite and dodge Thresh hooks thanks to the MS buff it gives, all while stacking his chakrams even more. At this point, Aphelios has a lot of stacks on his Crescendum (white) so all you need to do is back off and wait for his chakrams to go off, It literally only last for 5 seconds, so if ennemy team just waited 5 seconds, they would all have been fine and Aphelios couldn't do anything. 

Alternatively, using Severum's (red) Q made him switch weapon into his Calibrum (green), and because he already had Crescendum stacks, he could use Crescendum turrets Q with it as a combo. Again, Rushs team didn't respect it and chased him into the turrets while he had fully stacked Crescendum (white) instead of just backing off for literally 5 SECONDS. 

I know sometimes Aphelios lacks clarity (especially on his ultimate), but please, his chakrams being stacked is one of the clearest thing in the game, and the counterplay really is that easy. 

Aphelios is actually pretty balanced now, he's kinda of a jack of all trade ADC with clear strengths, but also very clear weaknesses and counterplays, if people just took 10 MINUTES to read his abilities or try them in practice mode, everybody would understand what he does and how to counter him."
660,5e3859dd841d20c9f2616319,Aphelios played that well
661,5e3859dd841d20c9f261631d,"Gonna have to go against the Reddit circlejerk a bit here; that Aphelios played that well. The combo he pulled off there is incredibly difficult. It required his ult, switching between 3 different guns, and multiple different abilities, all to stack up his Chakrams. He positioned well and reacted to the fight fantastically.

It's hard to tell what he's doing, but what he actually did was impressive. He played it well and deserves to be rewarded for it."
662,5e3859dd841d20c9f2616321,"I'd probably give aphelios a pass if his character was in any way interesting but everything about this champion just seems boring as fuck along with being broken as hell, all the concepts they showed on his reveal page would have resulted in more interesting characters.

Get him the fuck outta here."
663,5e3859dd841d20c9f2616325,"PLEASE. RIOT. JUST. DELETE. THIS. CHAMP. Seriously, this champ needs to just get removed completely."
664,5e3859dd841d20c9f2616329,With all the frustration aside I think that was really cool and well done by Aphelios. He kited perfectly and stacked his chakrams so well without missing a beat. This is one of the best Aphelios plays I’ve ever seen. And for a champion with such a high skill ceiling I’m excited to see even more cooler plays. If I hadn’t played league before and someone showed me this video I’d download the game immediately. certainlyT hit the nail on this one’s head. That being said maybe a little more clarity and counterplay would be nice.
665,5e3859dd841d20c9f261632d,200+ chakrams KEKW
666,5e3859dd841d20c9f2616331,Aphelios looks like me when I have a super OP synergy on Binding of Isaac.
667,5e3859dd841d20c9f2616335,😳😳 crazy epic outplay
668,5e3859dd841d20c9f2616339,Can someone tell me what the hell happened here?
669,5e3859dd841d20c9f261633d,champ was a mistake
670,5e3859de841d20c9f2616341,Aphelios is such a weird champion. I understand him pretty well but I have a good memory for stuff like that
671,5e3859de841d20c9f2616345,"Sometimes I think that I might just be too trash to understand what is happening on that champion but if a pro player also don't understand it, then..."
672,5e3859de841d20c9f2616349,Welcome to my world rush
673,5e3859de841d20c9f261634d,"Wait, if he has 20 stacks shouldn't just go away after use them?"
674,5e3859de841d20c9f2616351,Aphelios is like when you put a M.U.G.E.N. character in street fighter. Super broken and everything they do makes no sense visually. They also can just use one more and win the game.
675,5e3859de841d20c9f2616355,How many AAs did he auto senna at the end?
676,5e3859de841d20c9f2616359,This is the new thing with aphel instead of the flamethrower ult you stack chakrams and go to town. Love when I get 8+ stacks hunter comes to gank and I 1v3
677,5e3859de841d20c9f261635d,dat bois chakrams are aligned
678,5e3859de841d20c9f2616361,It's bad when even koreans who beat boshy with closed eyes don't know whats happening.
679,5e3859de841d20c9f2616365,"Damn that Zed ran up and got done up

Aphelios reminds me of Invoker where he has like 9 abilities but can still rotate through two or three of them to delete anything in the game"
680,5e3859de841d20c9f2616369,lmao they fed him chakrams and then decided to kiill him
681,5e3859de841d20c9f261636d,"Oh no, It has begun"

683,5e3859de841d20c9f2616375,Aphelios stacked charakcums. Personally that’s the one thing about his kit I don’t know how to use.
684,5e3859de841d20c9f2616379,"even after reading the nets to find out what happened, he still makes absolutely no sense. Riot made such a bad champion this time. Noone can figure out what hes doing and half the time I feel as though players dont fully know either but hes so strong it doesnt matter"

Riot may have already released all possible healthy champions, if so new champs will destroy playability by flooding with OP champs, not all design space is useable. Games shouldn't be decided in draft. Nerfing a champion out of the game is bad too, bad faith for anyone buying the champ/skins. Be more careful riot, put your combined 200 minutes of professional game design experience to use."
692,5e3859df841d20c9f2616399,This champion makes me want to play league again... but knowing that he will probably be permabanned and that the first 5-10 times I will hard feed on him so it will take me like a month to get enough games on him just to be semi comfortable makes me sad.

Before the nerfs im sure he was probably as broken as season 3 kassa was, not even a little bit of an exaggeration. And after all these hard nerfs he still is insanely op thats crazy"
709,5e3859e0841d20c9f26163dd,"Just remove Aphelios already, refund and delete."

711,5e3859e0841d20c9f26163e5,"I know people think Aphelios is broken but this is mechanic specifically is very obvious and imo is taken way out of context compared to the ultimate destinction problem. I know its unpopular opinion but max chakram Aphelios can be compared to 5 stack Darius. You just simply have to run away to timeout the stacks. I expect KR solo queue should know that 20 stacks of chakram will melt anyone reguardless of who they are. This is not to downplay the ultimate visual which is very difficult to distinct. Nonetheless, the amount of damage he did that fight was absurd, but I would not run straight into a 5 stack Darius... would you?"
712,5e3859e0841d20c9f26163e9,"He autoattacks with fully stacked boomerang? I really cannot see what is the problem here, it has been months and this is NOT a crazy combination of weird unreadable interactions if you have ever bothered to read his spell description once. 

Yes his infinite range should be infinitely more clear, but compared to him instantly swapping weapon and having an AOE flame then swapping back with no way to know, this is really straight forward autoattacking and marking. Just because rush overreacts it doesn't make it needlesly complicated. 

I don't go ""WHAT WAS THAT OMG NANDE"" every time cait hits me while im hit by her net or some shit either."

714,5e3859e0841d20c9f26163f1,Aphelios is fine. Bronzies and silvers are just mad they don't know what the hell is happening in the video because they haven't bothered to look up what Aphelios does or ever played him. It takes a lot of skill and mechanics to get that amount of chakrams up and you have to constantly be switching between your weapons and discarding weapons etc. Something isn't bad just because you don't understand it.
715,5e3859e0841d20c9f26163f5,This is broke . Change my view.

We dont need such shit in a moba game. I have seen aphelios just tank a turret 2v1 thanks to his life steal. Shoot people away by multiple screens etc. It doesnt matter how hard a champ is to play if in the end its broken as shit. XD"

722,5e3859e1841d20c9f2616411,"Actually a super well timed and executed play from the Aphelios player. You guys are fools to consider that bad design, and Rush is even more ridiculous, he should know what to expect from any given champion, especially 2 months after its release."

Since they have been working during the same time period they used the same technology and industry-best-practices, so it can be 30 years or 300 years, still mostly the same overlapping knowledge.


Or you can go to any random school, get all first year students together and get 2000+ years of experience together of people with no skill.


So either skill is overlapping or there is barely any skill and you reached that ""years of experience"" just by headcount."

Riot did the nerfs anyways while his post got downvoted to shits on reddit.

743,5e3859e2841d20c9f2616465,I felt the same way until I played a few games with him. Once you understand what the kit does with the different weapon combinations you realize what he's capable of doing throughout the game. Sniper and chakram feels completely unfair though lol.
744,5e3859e2841d20c9f2616469,Once you play him around 50 games you get the hang of combos and oh boi once you get the grasp of his mechanics 1v5 all day if they are all squishy

>Obviously doesn't read about new champions because the interaction shown in the video is described on multiple sites.

Aphelios's Chakram turret (Q) marks champions depending on what weapon he has as his secondary.
Aphelios's Calibrum (sniper rifle) marks champions so that he can attack the mark once, globally. 

Aphelios's Chakram gains a stacking damage bonus in the form of up to 20 additional chakrams when Aphelios uses a skill that throws his chakram.

Aphelios used Severum Q (the lifesteal weapon that looks like a sickle) which makes him attack with both weapons, stacking his chakram damage which he then switches to to get the ridiculous damage on his auto attacks.

This community needs to stop with the willful ignorance when they're complaining about champions, it makes us all look stupid. Is Aphelios broken and overloaded? Fuck yeah. Is he really that hard to figure out? NO. I uninstalled the game a month ago and I played Aphelios maybe twice in custom matches, yet I can explain to someone how this interaction happened."

Champion needs a visual rework ASAP, because this isn't a question of understanding what he does, it is a question of even being able to tell what he is doing in a way that is possible to process in the heat of the moment. I know what he can do, I can tell why this clip makes sense, but that's impossible to tell during a teamfight. I really hope he gets fixed soon, or we will probably either see him get Kalista'd into an unplayable state until Riot fixes him, or we will have our new p/b champion for 2020."

799,5e3859e6841d20c9f2616545,"Severum is practically a better Urgot W. Even if it has a low duration, it shits out so much more damage, further range, can critically strike, and actually speeds him up instead of slowing him down for some reason."
800,5e3859e6841d20c9f2616549,"The movespeed/attack speed/ moving while attacking is only the ability of the red gun (severum) it also life steals. I’m not defending the champion, just clarifying where that ability it coming from. It’s not a permanent state of the champ (again I’m NOT defending the champion being overpowered)"
801,5e3859e6841d20c9f261654d,Reminds me how overwatch heroes were added to hots with stuff u mentioned.
802,5e3859e6841d20c9f2616551,"Heh, the closest thing weve gotten to them admitting their mistakes is reverting after months of misery."
803,5e3859e6841d20c9f2616555,"People who say this should be banned. The amount of times Riot has admitted fault is insanely high for a game company.


You can think Aphelios is unacceptable. but saying ""Riot admit a mistake for once"" is literally just a bold faced lie"
804,5e3859e6841d20c9f2616559,"I havent even tried him in ai yet.
I returned a month or so ago. Did some quick ai just to get an idea on some champs after reworks and what not. Didnt even touch this guy since I already know his visuals suck and fighting one will still probably leave me confused.

Like sett? Okay. Punch, shield/true damage in center, and a pull/stun in the e.  Easy!

Senna? Q for heal, and poke, can be used in wards lol. Okay easy. And so on 

But this guy. Just wtf"
805,5e3859e6841d20c9f261655d,BRING BACK SPECTRAL THROW
806,5e3859e6841d20c9f2616561,He pulled pretty sick mechanics here thou.
807,5e3859e6841d20c9f2616565,"Sure, cuz Aphelios can just hit 1 button and he instantly gets a main-hand Calibrum, an off-hand Crescendum, and turrets automatically placed in strategic places to harass the enemy team."
808,5e3859e6841d20c9f2616569,"Every time I see someone trying to argue that Aphelios is mechanically intensive I just think of that Rick and Morty IQ copypasta.


You have people trying to argue that Apehlios is a high skill champ when most of his mechanics is point and click and an easier to use Urgot W. lol"
809,5e3859e6841d20c9f261656d,"They explicitly said he wasn't going to be mechanically intense.

However, what they did say, was he would be 200iq. That also failed. For the most part the guns are all just too good in too many situations."
810,5e3859e6841d20c9f2616571,From watching that video he looks mechanically intense to me. That combo he just did is hard to pull off and maintaining that many chakrams is extremely hard. He lacks some visual clarity because there’s so many thing going on but he’s definitely a high skill champ.
811,5e3859e6841d20c9f2616575,Yeah bro you're the first person to acknowledge that well done
812,5e3859e6841d20c9f2616579,"I don't understand. So if you're not a tank, you will be 100-0'd by stepping into the turret range for less than a second?"
813,5e3859e6841d20c9f261657d,Aphelios is really a visual nightmare
814,5e3859e6841d20c9f2616581,This is pretty much the big brain shit that Riot marketed Aphelios as. He just needs his numbers hard gutted so that you have to actually be creative and pull stuff off like this to be effective instead of just twoshotting someone with a couple Q sniper procs or oneshotting a team with a 5 man flamethrower ult.
815,5e3859e7841d20c9f2616585,"You have to be good to get that many chakram stacks. I bet rush had never seen that many stacks , so he is amazed and confused at the same time."
816,5e3859e7841d20c9f2616589,I dont even understand your explanation let alone the descriptions of the champ LMAO
817,5e3859e7841d20c9f261658d,Ahahahha yeah it was sick to watch
818,5e3859e7841d20c9f2616591,"My problem with it is that the projectiles are so dim that you notice them halfway to your ass. If he had like a big particle for each aa you could say ""oh THAT'S the little shit that's doing all this damage, let's hit him or something"" but no, they have the same visibility of draven's bugged axes that disappear when thrown."
819,5e3859e7841d20c9f2616595,"Ah, you mean the mechanically difficult task of:   


Saving Chakram in your off-hand. Deplete Gravitum beforehand."
820,5e3859e7841d20c9f2616599,He is really not fine from a design standpoint.
821,5e3859e7841d20c9f261659d,He also uses the chakram ult at the beginning to start the stack.
822,5e3859e7841d20c9f26165a1,"It’s so unclear what’s happening. Even if the convo makes sense, it’s a champ with so much variability that it’s impossible to really predict what he’ll do, or track his cool downs. 

He also gains “invisible” stats when he levels instead of ability levels, which makes it even harder to know what’s going on. 

I think we’ll see him get heavily nerfed, then reworked into a simpler/clearer design. Right now I hate watching games with Aphelios in them because it’s just not possible to follow that champ without his overlay."
823,5e3859e7841d20c9f26165a5,Hm do I know you?
824,5e3859e7841d20c9f26165a9,"I personally feel like he is only slightly overtuned, with a few really glaring mechanics that should not be in his kit (his inferno ult should not be a vastly stronger Brand ult, or it needs a delay that lets people respond to it by moving out of the way so your whole team isn't instantly oneshot), but overall, he feels fairly balanced. And I say this as someone who hasn't bothered learning to play him yet at all, with 3 games total so far. 

Clarity is the main issue by far, and I am 99% sure most of the problems that people have with him, is entirely on the visual aspect, not his actual numbers, even if people tunnel too hard on his damage potential. By and large, he isn't *that* much worse than certain other champions, but he currently have a massive advantage in that the player knows what is going on, and the enemy team does not. Even if you CAN figure it out during replays, that's not enough. You really need to be instantly aware of what he can do, and what he is even doing, at any given moment. Riot failed on that point. If everything was perfectly clear at a glance, in 99% sure Aphelios would be balanced at best, and even too weak at worst. The clip here is a good example of him getting a lot of damage out, simply because the enemy team can't understand what is happening. That teamfight would likely have looked way different had people known what to watch out for."
825,5e3859e7841d20c9f26165ad,Did Rush fall off that hard?
826,5e3859e7841d20c9f26165b1,He just ran away and placed turrets behind him lol. Once you get hit by the turrets you're dead as aphelios just has to right click you from a very safe distance away
827,5e3859e7841d20c9f26165b5,Why play Aphelios if I'll never reach that level of turret placement skills
828,5e3859e7841d20c9f26165b9,he pressed q geez
829,5e3859e7841d20c9f26165bd,Wait. At first I was merely suspicious of Riot Nephew and his strangely underdeveloped grammar...but now it’s all coming together
830,5e3859e7841d20c9f26165c1,"We're just over one month into this decade, and I'd like a redo."
831,5e3859e7841d20c9f26165c5,Except you can literally watch the spotlight and read his page to know what he does.
832,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165c9,He should massively embarrassed about this champion. There was clearly no oversight on this
833,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165cd,Same help a brotha out
834,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165d1,"He starts with moonlight vigil crescendum, which gives you 4 chakram plus one for each champion hit so one champion hit gives you 4, 2 gives 5, etc.   

Hitting enemies with abilities while crescendum is your off hand weapon gives you extra chakram.

Your severum(red lifesteal weapon) q makes you attack with both weapons 3 times each, giving you 3 extra chakram.

Then he cycles to calibrum (long range with global auto marks) switches back to crescendum, places a turret with calibrum equipped. Proccing the calibrum marks from turrets give extra chakrams up to 4 (the amount of times the turret can attack before dying). 

Think that’s it"
835,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165d5,He presses R
836,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165d9,You are speaking from a playing point of view. Playing against him is extremely frustrating because of the inability to see what he is doing while in team fights.
837,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165dd,"Wait...this is korean high elo. You don't think they know what aphelios does? Rush is astounded at how much damage he's allowed to do with one auto attack, not that he doesn't understand the stacking mechanic."
838,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165e1,"You spelled out the problem right at the end there; a jack of all trades with clear strengths.

In almost every game, a jack of all trades character or class should have no clear weaknesses or strengths, as they are perfectly balanced in all skills (which, in of itself, is the weakness; master of none)"
839,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165e5,"That's not the only problem people have with it though (multiple people say he played it well), it's the complete lack of clarity. It's near impossible to track what's going on with this guy in a teamfight.  
Like Rush said: what the fuck is actually happening right now."
840,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165e9,"I totally agree. It was so cool to watch. Makes me wanna go play Aphelios right now, but I’m probably gonna get one shot before stacking even 5 chakrams."
841,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165ed,"Lol who gives a shit.  As a top lane main, why the fuck do I have to figure out a strategy for the intricacies of a specific adc that has 25 different forms.  If Riot wants to make a high skill ceiling, low floor champ, then thats fine, but forcing everyone who doesnt play the champ to also decipher this shit is so unbelievably bad. 

If you ever want to look at Exhibit A on how Riots design team has no idea what they are doing, its this champ."
842,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165f1,Just tear him into 6 champs and we're good. Every ability and gun could comfortably make its own character.
843,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165f5,"Aphelios had mini chakrams already and Ulted to get more at the beginning. Having a lot of those makes him deal...idk but it’s shitloads of damage. He killed someone, then Zed, then switch to the pistol and used up his ammo for that giving him the sniper rifle. He then switches back to the chakrams to throw down a sniper turret which allows him to essentially basic attack with his chakrams from far away because of the marks from the sniper turret’s attacks (which means lots of damage from a good distance)."
844,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165f9,It goes away after a certain time.
845,5e3859e8841d20c9f26165fd,and by then he'll be gutted or reworked lmao
846,5e3859e8841d20c9f2616601,"Yea, but sometimes it's linked to totems, but luckily those aren't decoy totems and people let them get damage off"
847,5e3859e8841d20c9f2616605,Did you seriously just compare Darius' range to Aphelios' range?
848,5e3859e8841d20c9f2616609,didnt know a lcs player was a bronzie
849,5e3859e9841d20c9f261660d,As an adc this is completely balanced and fair. This is exactly what we wanted in s8! /s
850,5e3859e9841d20c9f2616611,Zed is dog shite at high level lol. Too much counterplay. No one even plays him in pro play

853,5e3859e9841d20c9f261661d,Reddit should be in responsible on the balance of the game. We have millions of years of collective experience in the game.

857,5e3859e9841d20c9f261662d,to expand your point. someone who talks  years experiences instead of experiences usually is bad anyways.
858,5e3859e9841d20c9f2616631,"Yeah the old ""combined experience"" thing is pretty much always a dumb statement no matter what context its used. It doesn't shut down debate or settle stuff or anything, it's a non-statement. There's zero substance to it. You may as well just speak that line in Chinese because it would help your argument just the same."

Would you rather have 1 person w/ 12 years experience, or 12 people with 1 year of experience.  (senior in H.S. vs  12 1st graders)  


From now on, the idea of collective experience will mean absolutely nothing to me.  


You could literally be stacking people with 1 year of experience  , or overlapping identical experience (like 3 ppl with 20 years of experience doing the same thing)  --- think about like it this way --- if you had a combined experience of 100 years of making burgers, sounds like it might be the best burgers ever, right? Nah, its just your average Burger King with some people that have been there 20 years...

In the Mythbusters they used that phrase to say that both of them are very experienced in their industries and that their expertise doesn't overlap that much.

919,5e3859ed841d20c9f2616725,The turret gave him range to fight from behind two walls. How can anyone even CC him?
920,5e3859ed841d20c9f2616729,How could they cc him when he was in the tribush and they were in the river?
921,5e3859ed841d20c9f261672d,Thats true for all champs except olaf. If they get cced they die (provided the have the appropriate focused fire).
922,5e3859ed841d20c9f2616731,This has been the stupidest argument in league of legends since I can remember. CC being the only counterplay to a champion is not balanced.

Yoricks ghoul are not as devastating as you are partially tank too and can be killed.  So why does aphelios get to continually use it as much in the teamfight?   Just curious...  it is juat such a random ability that it should have been isolated to a different marksman that was built around it imo. And not 10 other things as well..
930,5e3859ee841d20c9f2616751,Stay away??  Did ya see the part he's doing a ton of damage from a mile away in darkness?
931,5e3859ee841d20c9f2616755,"First time I played him was in ARAM, went in completely blind. Got a quadra by basically mashing buttons and ended the game with a 16/3/20+ scoreline. I had no idea what I was doing beyond understanding that the character switches guns that do different things. I was nervous because I kept hearing how he was a high-skill champ with a lot of complexity to perform well but I didn't get that impression."
932,5e3859ee841d20c9f2616759,Rush is the type of player to ban the new champion in every single match though.  It wouldnt surprise me if this this is one of the first times he has played against one.

I know what he can do, I can tell why this clip makes sense, but that's impossible to tell during a teamfight.

That's a great way of putting it.  
I swear I read the entire novel that is the wiki on Aphelios, put in a decent amount of games on it and played a bunch against it and I still get flummoxed playing against this thing."
937,5e3859ee841d20c9f261676d,"Visual rework is fine but considering the fact he has no escape, he should have at least Draven dmg when even Draven has escapes - a displace AND a Ms buff"

Let them make some changes on the PBE so that players can actively follow and have some idea of when Aphelios is deemed acceptable again.

It would only really hurt the players who would want to one trick him in ranked, and probably this season. You can still buy and experience his skin(s) in normals."
941,5e3859ee841d20c9f261677d,"To me it's not really a visual/clarity problem. It's more about how many stupid mechanics he has and that he's just straight up overtuned.

With the nerf next patch they'll finally get 1 out of his 5 weapons in a decent state and it only took 4-5 patches."

947,5e3859ef841d20c9f2616795,The problem is that 90% of the people seeing this can't tell. That's just how dumb of a champion it is.
948,5e3859ef841d20c9f2616799,Eh. He had some decent decision-making but I wouldn't call any of this impressive mechanically.
949,5e3859ef841d20c9f261679d,He put a sniper turret then auto attacked! WOW! l33t mechanix bro. He totally deserved to 2 shot anyone from 1000 range after that 500 iq intense mechanical champ mastery display
950,5e3859ef841d20c9f26167a1,"Most good Aphelios players always leave Crescendum in the off-hand until it is time to fight. That means the only consideration is your main-hand. All the remaining guns can be useful from here. Either he can ult with flamethrower/graviton for burst/cc, or he uses Severum/Calibrum for high sustained damage.

You can try to pretend like he big-brained this play, but the truth is that you just work with what you have currently. In this case he happened to have Severum main-hand.

Aphelios just looks complicated. He isn't. The only thing you have to do to play him well is keep Crescendum in off-hand until you have to fight, and have your reload order be Severum>Calibrum>Gravitum>Infernum (which is the natural order)"
951,5e3859ef841d20c9f26167a5,"well why bother when you can 1 shot the entire team with your ult by pressing 1 button with the help of 200 yeahrs of expeirence?

 Honestly this champ needs a rework as stuiped as this sounds but this champ needs half of his interactions removed"
952,5e3859ef841d20c9f26167a9,"so? you talking as if he is the most difficult champion in this game? NO 

hes not even difficult to use mechanically as compared to many other champion and he is still busted right now 

idk what you are getting at here? he played that well? nope just normal from an aphelios player is that difficult to do? NOPE

&#x200B;

is that difficult to play with? FKING YES 

is that difficult to see what he did in the middle of teamfight due to lack of clarity? FKING YES

is that difficult to understand even if you played against him for the 100th time? FKING YES

&#x200B;

thats the problem not that this play is hard to do, its just anything a aphelios can do just with the right weapon that none of the opponent would know cos who knows what offhand he have now"
953,5e3859ef841d20c9f26167ad,All his guns are good. There’s no bad combinations. His combos ranges from good to broken and are viable in every situation. It makes the ammo management and deciding what guns you use overrated.
954,5e3859ef841d20c9f26167b1,"Fr, you don't get to call it a mechanical play because 20 minutes ago you decided to waste 4 extra AAs on creep."

956,5e3859ef841d20c9f26167b9,nope try playing as aphelios a few game and you would know how EASY it is to play as him
957,5e3859ef841d20c9f26167bd,"This clip is not hard to do, they just played bad into him too, everyone just kept walking into him 1by1 and allowed him to stack the chakrams, but i have to say i still think the chakrams are way too strong and need a nerf, they stack way too fast and are by far the only weapon you'd seriously always want to have as Aphelios because they just combo way too well with every other weapon he has.

All he did in this clip was AA anyone close while kiting back to stack the chakrams and placing turrets that would just let him auto from the safe range. The only skill he had here was kiting and target selection which pretty much any adc mains at his level have."

961,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167cd,"If the aphelios has that many shurikens around him, and the turret has the sniper weapon, then yes, otherwise it’s just a stronger timed version of heimer’s turrets/Zyra’s plants"
962,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167d1,"Yes, but only if the Aphelios has actually put in the time and effort to set up his combo in advance, which is actually quite fair IMO. The point is, like the OP stated, that his visuals are such a mess that you can't figure out what the hell is happening"
963,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167d5,"For 'less than a second' you'll just deactivate it by stepping backwards. If you don't react immediately, you'll eat 1 autoattack, which obviously hurts since he's an ADC. If you stand still in the turret range or try to fight it (within the range), you'll just eat marks like an idiot, while keep giving him free stacks and free resets.

Actually his chakrum goes off in a second or even less. 1 syndra's E and he's useless. As a support main I don't really know what kind of big brain do you need to ult on Aphelios as Zed when this guy have SO MANY circular saws around him.

EDIT: reset timer lasts 5 seconds, mb for desinformation. It usually takes 1 hook from me to prevent him from getting resets, so I was assuming it's like a second or two."
964,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167d9,"Which is what most midlaners can do to any nontank too! Come to think of it, a lot of tanks oneshot squishies too.. (I don't like aphelios either though)"
965,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167dd,"However it's very hard and specific to stack up 20 chakrams, the turret obviously costs 10 ammo, and you need to set up your three guns and queue beforehand - it's not that he's just oneshotting people with the turret, it's a specific combo to do that. There are one or to other ways but require even more. If they didn't chase into the turret for 5 seconds while the chakrams ran out then they could have killed him much easier. He was already disengaging from the fight so Senna should have just moved to dragon."
966,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167e1,"If the weapons are chakras and sniper and he has 20 chakrams, yes. 

The turret is way too subtle for how powerful it can be."
967,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167e5,"Yeah because just hit the turret that takes 3 autos to destroy, duh.

Also super fun fact, despite using ward-style health Aphelios turret doesn't take 1,5 damage from melee champions, just 1. Why? Because he's special like that and CertainlyT's champs don't have to conform to the same game mechanics as everyone else."
968,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167e9,"Well the play is to recognize Aphelios has about 20 chakrams floating around him, disengage/fight slow till they drop, then re-engage. Also doesn't help that Maokai just kinda let Aphelios stack up another like 5 chakrams by face tanking turret and sniper Q's."
969,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167ed,"Turrets are broken and don't work half the time, also, he has 0 escapes so even 1 cc is gg"
970,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167f1,"He really is.

Even if you throw all balance arguments out the window. What the fuck am I even looking at with this video."
971,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167f5,"Then he will be useless, because a simpler adc would be far more effective. All aphelios does is damage. No fancy mobility/stealth etc outplay possibilities.

Not that id complain. Fuck aphelios"
972,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167f9,This type of situation you get once in a blue moon if he had to do this to do any damage he would be fucking useless.
973,5e3859f0841d20c9f26167fd,"if jinx loses 25% attack speed in rocket form, i dont know why none of Aphelios weapons have any drawback at all."
974,5e3859f0841d20c9f2616801,i guess the real big brane is the one you need to understand what the fuck is going on.
975,5e3859f0841d20c9f2616805,tell me where you see the amazed from? please LOL
976,5e3859f1841d20c9f2616809,I really really don't feel like that's the issue with the chakrams though.  I feel that the massive whirlwind of blades around him that would go flying at the enemies were very visible in this clip rofl
977,5e3859f1841d20c9f261680d,I'd like to think you do!
978,5e3859f1841d20c9f2616811,Combined with 20 chakrams which he stacked by entering the fight with pistol. Rolling sniper gives his turrets the mark which lets him dish out 20 chalrams which he stacked with pistol q earlier on each super long range auto
979,5e3859f1841d20c9f2616815,I can't stand when adcs run away while clicking on people so unskilled.

985,5e3859f1841d20c9f261682d,Aphel’s weakness is that all of his power is conditional based on the guns he has.
986,5e3859f1841d20c9f2616831,No I did not compare their range. I compared how both having multiple stacks is very deadly and should not be chased. Another example would be Jinx with get excited stacks. Would you (as Senna for example in the clip) chase a 3 stack excited Jinx?

And only the sniper-shot, the turret, and his ult has any further combinations (as far as I remember/know) with his other skills. I haven't found him hard to figure out, though I do find him semi-annoying to play well. Though, that probably has more to do with playing ARAM over the champ himself. His life-steal blades and chakrams have very niche uses and are a pain to switch out of sometimes. Again, this is as far as I've figured out."
1009,5e3859f2841d20c9f261688d,"Its really not tbh. If you take aph and go to prac tool for 20 mins, you get a good enough idea of what he does to play around him in a general sense.  You dont need to understand the champ in a way where you yourself could do that play

Tldr if youre playing an assassin and you see that aph has chakrams spinning around him, he can possibly outplay you bc of his insane damage in melee range, its not intuitive and probably not balanced, but it takes a while to ramp"
1010,5e3859f3841d20c9f2616891,You need to spend like half an hour playing him and then it's braindead easy to understand. Becomes very clear why he's broken lol. Every single one of his guns interacts with each other. You don't have to worry about managing ammo when every single combo of guns has synergy. Playing him is the easiest way to see all of the interactions

1026,5e3859f3841d20c9f26168d1,"It can be hidden in a frozen wave way too easily, I go to clear the wave in front of my turret and get hit by 5 chakrams from the other side of the map"
1027,5e3859f4841d20c9f26168d5,"It's really not that different to rapid fire long range Caitlyn headshots. The problem is that you often miss the very subtle presence of the turret that allows this to happen, and if too much is going on, it is really not fair to expect the players to know how to play around it. 

It is powerful zone control, basically a kill zone when he pair it with the range, but it should be vastly more obvious what is going on."
1028,5e3859f4841d20c9f26168d9,It's called Bowlcut for a reason
1029,5e3859f4841d20c9f26168dd,I would prefer he stays in the dumpster with a 35% winrate
1030,5e3859f4841d20c9f26168e1,Kalista has balance issues due to her insane skill ceiling (similar to Azir) but I wouldn't say that she has clarity issues like Aphelios does.
1031,5e3859f4841d20c9f26168e5,"I have played aphelios a couple times, read his abilities, and I still have no idea how the fuck his primary and secondary weapons interact"
1032,5e3859f4841d20c9f26168e9,"It is but he has literally skewed the game design in a horrible direction that leads to obnoxious 0 counter play champions that is all about looking amazing and being the hero.

It is really bad for the game and extremely toxic for the game in the long term. Champions like Yasou, Zoe, Aphelios and Kalista is actually ruining the long term balance of the game to such a degree that league has never been in as horrible a state gameplay wise as it is now. It is entirely living on its past legacy and an addicted playerbase.

I can with 100% confidence say that if you removed every champion he created the game would be better than it with them. Better in the sense of balance and better in the sense of fun."
1033,5e3859f4841d20c9f26168ed,"Thanks! I have read it, but it is pretty overwhelming for me. I have been playing since Season 2."
1034,5e3859f4841d20c9f26168f1,"You can play as if he has everything until you know. It's not different from knowing if a champion has flash or not. Unless you know, you assume he has flash."
1035,5e3859f4841d20c9f26168f5,"I'm not really sure how to simplify it much, but I personally think it's kind of straight forward so I will do my best. 

Each gun has its own ability. Each gun will change the effect of the ult depending on which is equipped. 

He can have two guns equipped at once and they will effect each other. This means he can use the sniper rifle to mark people, which will also proc the effect of the second weapon, for example, the dagger which life steals.

He can do this with any combination of weapons. 

1. **Sniper rifle** is a long distance skill shot that marks whoever it hits. You can then right click them from any distance to get a free auto attack. The ult will mark everyone hit, and then hit all of them with an auto attack.
2. **Gravity cannon** is a skill that when you hit someone with an auto/other ability, you can then slow/root them with the ability. The ultimate marks anyone hit, which will slow them, and then a follow up root can be applied with the active ability. 
3. **Dagger** steals life when it hits. The ability rapidly attacks while moving for lowered damage, it will also rapidly proc the off hand guns effect. It only really does anything with Chakram, however. The ultimate just steals a bunch of life from everyone hit by it.
4. **Chakram** attacks faster the closer you are. The ability places a turret. The turret will proc the effect of the secondary gun. This is particularly strong with the sniper rifle since anyone that gets hit by the turret, will then be hit with an infinite ranged auto attack as well. The Chakram also has the passive ability to gather chakrams which increases his auto attack damage. You get them by hitting people with off hand abilities while having Chakram equipped, or by hitting them with the Chakram ultimate. 
5. **Flamethrower** is basically a shotgun. The ability fires a wave of flame. The ultimate will fire a ring of fire around anyone hit by the ultimate. Lots of AOE damage.


Now just mix and match every gun and that's Aphelios, it's not too bad to understand, you just have to spend a bit more time reading about him than other champs because this information is horribly conveyed in game. Most champs you can learn simply by playing against, but Aphelios is extremely shit in that regard. His readability in game needs to be fixed immediately. 

Hope that helps a little for anyone confused."
1036,5e3859f4841d20c9f26168f9,"Xayah and Kaisa will always do well because of their kits. The rest of the adc pool dont have that level of survability in this meta where you get oneshotted by anything (maybe ezreal but he lacks reliable dps in exchange)

But yeah I missed senna adc and mf but thats mainly because they are closer to ad casters rather than adcs."

He’s only been out for like 3 months, no way to know what he does at all. Clearly not a giant visual clue that he has a bunch of chakrams"
1076,5e3859f6841d20c9f2616999,"The poster above you is wrong though. These are not sick mechanics. The only mechanics here are press Q and auto attacking.

But as you said, 90% of the people seeing this can't tell."

1079,5e3859f7841d20c9f26169a5,"Rito never marketed Aphelios as mechanically difficult but a big brain champ instead.

And of course he played that well. He stacked his chakrams, his positioning was good during the fight and he placed his turret with Calibrum just in the right spot to keep harassing the enemy team and preventing them from chasing him. All that I see is a good ADC player that knows how to take full advantage of Aphelios' kit. That's what Rito was aiming to (altho its a different story from the other side, the enemy team).

""is that difficult to understand even if you played against him for the 100th time?"" But what if you played **as** Aphelios 10 games? After testing the champion and his interactions by yourself, it becomes clearer to see what he's doing (altho seeing what he **could** is still hard do to visual clarity). I saw the turret placed in the floor and the chakrams flying through the air from downtown and I immediately knew he was using Crescendum + Calibrum.

Rito is already doing work to fix his visuals, starting with making clear which off-hand weapon he has. And his numbers are being tweaked each patch.

And, no, not every Aphelios player can do what is shown here, it requires knowledge about the champion, anticipation to make sure you have the right weapons for the fight and correct execution."

Not this again.

It wasnt fair when Syndra, with some setup time, could one shot you with a point and click ability, and it isnt fair when Aphelios, with some setup time, can one shot with unavoidable global Auto Attacks."
1085,5e3859f7841d20c9f26169bd,"are the turrets visible on your map? i dont think so. no matter how much time a champ puts in, if they other has literally zero counterplay a oneshot is not justified. i mean a player could just jump a wall into area he didnt get vision and gets oneshot from aphelios out of base."
1086,5e3859f7841d20c9f26169c1,What are you even talking about? His Crescendum last 5 seconds and they refresh the duration if he hits someone with them. If the Aphelios plays well like in the clip he can have up to 20 of them. That with the sniper turrets means that if the turret marks you once you die as all 20 of the charkrum will hit you.
1087,5e3859f7841d20c9f26169c5,">For 'less than a second' you'll just deactivate it by stepping backwards. If you don't react immediately, you'll eat 1 autoattack, which obviously hurts since he's an ADC. If you stand still in the turret range or try to fight it (within the range), you'll just eat marks like an idiot, while keep giving him free stacks and free resets.

okay if you look at the exact timestamps you see that the turret gets placed at second 0:20. Thresh dies the same second so the turret focuses Senna after 0:21. If you look closely Senna did indeed react immediately after the turret was placed but she still died in less then 2 seconds from autoattacks that came from way out of her range. Literally no way to outplay that other than ""dOnT bE nEaR hIs TuRrEt"".

edit: word"
1088,5e3859f7841d20c9f26169c9,He drops turrets that are stronger than a 1k ap heimer ult what’s so hard to understand about that. Also can infinitely Caitlin ulti gosh so balanced
1089,5e3859f7841d20c9f26169cd,"great, a new thing i didn't know about aphelios. So besides all his different weapons, the different Q effects that come with them, the different ulti effects that he has, the ammo you had to track, the order of weapons you have to know, you also have to pay attention to how many circular things he has around him at all times.

G R E A T"
1090,5e3859f7841d20c9f26169d1,"I think there is space in the 150+ roster (i know not all are ADC/bot laners) to have champs that aren't optimal picks but fit a playstyle and ""funstyle"" niche."
1091,5e3859f7841d20c9f26169d5,"I'm inclined to agree with you, but then I think of champions like Xerath, Vel'Koz, Brand and wonder why Riot's modern design trade-off for not having mobility is 'doing literally everything else' i.e. AoE, lifesteal, sniping, sustain, and soft/hard CC -- resourcelessly.

I think Senna is pretty cool, but as a Xerath/former Karthus player, it feels bad watching her basically be a better version of both champs combined, but also with heals.  Executes across the map better than Karthus does since his R nerf, snipes like Xerath Q's, but targeted . . . etc.

Maybe I'm just being salty, but it feels like you can compare old immobile mages to new releases and see a huge power creep/overload creep."
1092,5e3859f8841d20c9f26169d9,"I mean you could argue the same thing with champions like Draven or Fiora.

Why ever play Draven if you can just play another ADC and not have to play a stupid mini game.

Why ever play Fiora if you can just play another split pusher and not have to play a stupid mini game."
1093,5e3859f8841d20c9f26169dd,"Not entirely true. All most AD carries do is damage, and very few of them give anything else. Aphelios also has reliable hard CC, potentially in an AoE which is incredibly strong on AD carries (there is a reason why most AD carry hard CC is either on an ultimate or conditional). 

On top of that it's dishonest. He has a baseline bloodthirster. He has good single target, he has good AoE, he gets to be Caitlyn without an attack speed penalty, he has incredibly cheesy combos, he has good turret pushing, he has good objective killing. He can stand to lose shit without being unplayable because he does so much to begin with.

I mean on release we had Infernum videos every day because that shit was obscene. It got nerfed and now we get Crescendum videos because it's also broken. When Crescendum gets nerfed we'll get, IDK, snipe videos or whatever because he just has so much shit on his kit it's stupid."
1094,5e3859f8841d20c9f26169e1,"And this is why Aphelios' design is hot garbage. With his pseudo-RNG weapons that are all samey this is the only outcome. Maybe a more distinct set of weapons with greater difference between them, and with different combos costing different amount of ammo and mana, and direct control of his abilites, and an ult that wasn't just more AAs. But sadly we are far past the point where such a conversation should be had."
1095,5e3859f8841d20c9f26169e5,Jinx can switch her weapon freely while Apehlios has to queue them up. It would feel awful to be stuck to a weapon with a drawback with only some pseudo-control.
1096,5e3859f8841d20c9f26169e9,"Because Riot has a fetish for giving every new champion all the tools they need to excel in whatever situation they may come across, with Aphelios because the magnum opus of shitty design."
1097,5e3859f8841d20c9f26169ed,"He used up his severum ammo before his sniper sometime during the game and now their reload order is changed, wow what a play. Oh he pressed q to get 10 more chakrams very skillful. Literally gives him like a 90% bonus AD scaling on his autos for pressing one button"

If you agree with it or not, that's the entire point. You see the comma in the middle of the sentence? It separates the two observations he made: 

The first one is that the other guy only has experience playing League of Legends.

The second one is that Riot's employees have experience in game design.

So not, by *that logic* riot does not have to let you balance the game, cause the users of this subreddit only play the game, but have no idea about game design. Surely there are some among us here, but they're not getting much say in between the ""nerf Pyke, remove Windwall, disable Aphelios"" posts."
1103,5e3859f8841d20c9f2616a05,"technically, most of reddit doesnt have collective experience designing games. lots of people with 0 experience is still 0"

The amount of abilities he has gives him so many ways to play fights, and if his weapons swap mid fight or if his off hand happens to be something you weren’t expecting. You get killed"
1116,5e3859f9841d20c9f2616a39,It's extremely difficult knowing which guns he has up at what time

1122,5e3859f9841d20c9f2616a51,I blocked him a long time ago so I wouldnt have to see it so idk. One of the most nauseating content creators lol
1123,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a55,I thought the same thing so yesterday so i checked his channel and he hasnt uploaded for 3 years now. I didnt feel like finding out why though
1124,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a59,"Hasn't uploaded for 3 years.  I think he said that he had issues with the fame/popularity, and it made him too nervous to keep making content.  Still plays League though afaik."
1125,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a5d,Idk but good riddance.
1126,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a61,He was exposed and dropped
1127,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a65,That looks wayyy more than 20
1128,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a69,Ok but why does it stack up to fucking 20
1129,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a6d,doesn't cait have to land skills to get those long range headshots though
1130,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a71,"I'd prefer he didn't exist, he doesn't even add anything significant to the lore beyond being another Lunari.

At least Senna, for all the hate that she gets (even though she's not particularly poorly designed, more not well-balanced) gave a form of closure to Lucian's lore and expanded his character, Aphelios just... exists as a Lunari. He doesn't even have significant interactions with Leona or Diana."
1131,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a75,Yep. Just relegate him to the cellar until he's overhauled.
1132,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a79,I would prefer riot flat out stops making and reworking champions- at least for the foreseeable future. So far it seems like they break every new champ for a few patches just to sell more skins.

1135,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a85,"The subject of the sentence was implied to be Aphelios, the kalista treatment was the object. I was talking about Aphelios' clarity issues, not Kalista.

I think Kalista actually has a *ton* of clarity on all of her spells, with the exception of E, which is still ""more spears = more damage"". It makes me sad to see her in her current state, but it would not make me sad whatsoever to see Aphelios in that state (which cannot be said for any other champ in the game)"
1136,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a89,"except her biggest problem is because in proplay, her baron taking and support saving are the biggest problem"
1137,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a8d,I dont know how this is not talked about more. He is a good designer but a terrible one for League of Legends. He should be working on wow or something like that.
1138,5e3859fa841d20c9f2616a91,"I've seen those comment on how LoL is bad now compared to XX event, since season 2 (i started a long time ago) . And to be faire you guys don't realise how the game made progress, don't get me wrong Aphelios confuse the shit out of me too, i'm just saying that argument isn't true, last 2 seasons were probably the best"

Also trying the champ usually is the fastest way to understanding it"
1140,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616a99,Tier rating wise they both took a pretty big hit
1141,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616a9d,"You can use whatever build you want. Want to play Sacrifice Black Tar Voodoo dogs with no cooldown reduction? Go right ahead, but it won't get you anywhere on ladder. I used to play a Holy chains with bonus lightning damage 2 hand crusader with no extra attack speed and I had fun. I killed stuff. But then I started getting sets, and I played (pre every components for this build getting buffed out the ass) akarats champ holy shotgun. That was so much more fun than holy chains every 5 seconds. My point is, there's fun, the fun you get from seeing a build come together, then theres the fun from competing with your build with bleeding edge gear, at the highest of the high ranks, against people who do the same thing. (And I don't min max, just try to collect every set, no matter the stats)"
1142,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616aa1,"Yes, it does. It ""steals"" 10% max HP, but it subtracts it from your current one. It just can't set you below 1."
1143,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616aa5,genuine question because I don’t play against him often: can you see how stacked his chakram is?
1144,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616aa9,It looks like he had a lot of self defense when zed ulted
1145,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616aad,">  self defense.

kills a fed Zed in under a second"
1146,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616ab1,"Right, but what 1 other ADC could do what Aphelios did here?"
1147,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616ab5,yea in a teamfight definitely tell your whole team to back off from adc
1148,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616ab9,havent played him in a while but its doable if you have the red q
1149,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616abd,But if he ults he can get a shit ton of chakrams while being a screen away. Theres a whole bunch of Bs with this champ.
1150,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616ac1,Except Darius needs to get into melee range.
1151,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616ac5,"during a teamfight better tell your teammate to backoff after seeing aphelios have 10 stacks 

definitely gonna work 100% of the time 

&#x200B;

1152,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616ac9,Then maybe dont answer to people like they were 10 y old
1153,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616acd,"Yep, evidently, Rush didn't take the time to understand how it works. If I did, he can do too."
1154,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616ad1,Nemesis a pro player who is very knowledgeable about the game only found out that if you are slowed liandries does more damage the other week. Should we remove liandries?
1155,5e3859fb841d20c9f2616ad5,"Every single champion has some sort of mechanic that is not explicit in the visuals of their kit. There's no excuse to not read the kit of new/reworked champions, let alone try them if they can be played in your main roles. I perfectly understood what was happening in the clip cuz I play Aphelios, so I know my champion. I'm not saying everyone should play him (people are too lazy for that), I'm just saying they should take the time to learn his multiple interactions (people are also too lazy for that). However, just by reading them it may not be enough to identify his animations, for that you need to play a lot with/against him, and once you start linking what you read with what you saw, it becomes clearer."
1156,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616ad9,"If you cant figure what his kit does after a few matches... his kit, not all the combos he has, only his kit... maybe League is not for you dude."

1158,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616ae1,"The only issue I have with Ornn is his mana costs are basically nothing. I like to compare tanks to other tanks. Comparing him to Maokai and I'm always like ""wow every ability on Ornn does a lot of damage, and costs no mana"" whereas I look at Maokai and I'm like ""wow only 1 ability does any damage and yet every ability costs more mana than any of Ornn's abilities""

Also I just checked, why the hell does Ornn have a 1.1 AD scaling on his q?!?!??!"
1159,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616ae5,"Yeah, the Ornn apologists are mostly in this sub, strangely.  They're all over."
1160,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616ae9,I’ve been abusing Ornn recently. He has insane burst potential that people are unaware of. He can literally 1 shot someone at level 6 from 700 HP with perfect cc overlap. That’s like 1/2-2/3 of someone’s health at lvl 6. All base damage btw...
1161,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616aed,"He can, but i dont think he is busted at all. The key is to just keep from from feeding early game"
1162,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616af1,his damage is fine. It's just how tanky he gets WHILE doing that damage that's the issue.
1163,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616af5,His passive
1164,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616af9,"> unmissable ult

I see there are still folks who literally haven't played him yet

Not to mention that Aphelios literally never has access to all of those things at once."
1165,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616afd,I mean aphelios probably still needs nerfs but you acting as if draven and aphelios ult aren‘t pretty much as easy to hit as the other is wrong and aphelios has these things situational you can‘t just combine all of his weapon abilities and act like he has the ability to choose between them
1166,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616b01,"He absolutely does. You should see some of the diamond one tricks. 

The problem now tends to be that Draven is under leveled in S10 compared to the solo lane."
1167,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616b05,no pls
1168,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616b09,"Idk why they removed the nerf that probably would make her fair to play against which was that immobilizing effects would reveal her during W.

If Riot without second thoughts made it so a hard cc could make Yuumi completely worthless for 5 seconds to reduce frustration they might as well add a little bit of counterplay to Akali shroud."
1169,5e3859fc841d20c9f2616b0d,Im genuinely curious as to why his turret almost deal as much damage as a champion and why his scythe has a built in BT passive that doesnt wear off.

and? im supposed to play every champion for 10 games before i can understand them? 

am i supposed to?

&#x200B;

doesnt that alone shows how broken his design is? I played dota and playing against invoker dont even cause that much problem with his skills being so simple to understand

&#x200B;

how does league copy a hero and make it so bad that everyone is complaining about it? they literally have a model to follow nothing too hard to do isnt it?

&#x200B;

Also even doublelift cant completely understand aphelios after playing for so long have you seen the game against dig? A pro ADC player cant understand aphelios completely and here you are saying oh its totally balanced like huh your brain went short circuit or what?

I see pro and grandmaster challenger player having a problem with him and here you are trying to make it seems like this champion only have problem with his visual clarity of course its not just that"

it’s still pretty disgusting though"
1179,5e3859fd841d20c9f2616b35,"Almost exactly what I said, the turret has the sniper weapon, which marks the enemy and generates shurikens, qt just autoes lucian with the shurikens generates, lucian had more than enough time get out"

1181,5e3859fd841d20c9f2616b3d,"Aphelios only did that much because he stacked 20 chakrams in the first place, he wouldn't have them outside of a teamfight. Plus they're already removing the global hits"

Theres a lot of champions capable of oneshotting you if you step into the wrong brush tho"
1183,5e3859fd841d20c9f2616b45,But that applies to a lot of champs lol. Don't be jumping into unwarded areas when most champs are missing
1184,5e3859fd841d20c9f2616b49,"How about Syndra’s R? Same principle, and it’s an actual one-shot. Also, Heimer’s turrets, Maokai’s saplings, Zyra’s plants, and Jhin’s traps. All of them will kill you if you give the champion time to prepare, and none of them show up on your map."
1185,5e3859fd841d20c9f2616b4d,"So since you concede that he just does a lot of damage and doesn't 'oneshot people with zero counterplay' does this also mean you think teemo shrooms are op?

And wtf is the argument about jumping a wall about?
If you jump a wall and you don't have vision of the other side there are like 50 champs in the game that will oneshot you."
1186,5e3859fd841d20c9f2616b51,"Even if all 20 chakram hits you, that only does like 2.2 AD. Hardly a line shot unless he's ridiculously fed."
1187,5e3859fd841d20c9f2616b55,"Sorry, my bad, didn't know how long exactly it lasts. I don't play the champ. Usually it takes 1 hook from me to prevent him from getting resets, so I was assuming it's like a second or two."
1188,5e3859fd841d20c9f2616b59,"You already know he have chakrums and he already stacked A LOT of these. In which universe do you think this Aphelios WON'T place his turret right in the bush where you're chasing him like an idiots?

Yes his champ is broken right now, but what would he do with it? Not abuse it? It's obvious af and I don't know what this Senna was thinking."
1189,5e3859fe841d20c9f2616b5d,I didn't say he's balanced. I said as long as you see a BIG SPARKLY FRAME OF 9 CIRCULAR SAWS around him you can figure out that it could be dangerous to fight him without CC. The same thing I say every time when my adc loses 1v1 and ragequits with a childish hysteria. That's all.
1190,5e3859fe841d20c9f2616b61,"To be fair, the circular things around him *is* one of the Q effects.

It's what happens when he has chakram in his off-hand and his mainhand Q would cause his chakrams to be thrown. Basically just Severum and Inferum Q, and *only* if he has chakram in his offhand."
1191,5e3859fe841d20c9f2616b65,Don't forget to mention all the different interactions of his weapon combinations!

1193,5e3859fe841d20c9f2616b6d,Sure why not. Slap him next to Kalista to never see the light of bot lane again.

It's so unfun to play against them, mainly in top lane cause that's where lots of them seem to be."
1197,5e3859fe841d20c9f2616b7d,It's more like those older champs needs an update
1198,5e3859fe841d20c9f2616b81,I'm not sure how good of an example that is because those two are regularly rewarded with being the BIS champs for playing around their minigame well.

1200,5e3859fe841d20c9f2616b89,Hey look I await your clip of a challenger game where you fo something more mechanically complicated
1201,5e3859fe841d20c9f2616b8d,True. I would agree. Thats what I stated in my original reply. But at the end it doesnt excuse the fact that he had about 20 stacks of chakram which is due to a long extensive teamfight and both enemy champions decided to walk into fog of war to chase him. 20 stacks isnt normal. Due to severum q it stacks up insanely fast. He essentially had the perfect weapons for a extensive teamfight. Added to that he placed his turret in an unwarded bush. But I do agree visually its a problem.
1202,5e3859fe841d20c9f2616b91,"Seriously by that logic OP *has* to repost. I mean we have over 10 million karma together.

Make his turrets have a moon shroud effect, kinda like how Kindred ult looks, and you would be able to instantly know to avoid that area. Right now, it is very easy to miss his turrets due to how subtle the area circle is, and how small the turret itself is. 

Aphelios does require a specific weapon setup to do this, too, so he can't just do this whenever he wants. That's no excuse to have terrible visual cues, however."
1223,5e385a00841d20c9f2616be5,"I agree, I prefer if he didn't exist at all too. He's a complicated champion for the sake of being complicated and his kit is incredibly overloaded. I mean, he's almost literally several champions combined. He has the Ashe-stance (slow gun), he has the Caitlyn+Heimerdinger-Stance, etcetc. 

I truly hate(d) Zoe, but the level of disgust I felt for her doesn't even tickle the level of disgust I feel for Aphelios."
1224,5e385a00841d20c9f2616be9,"this senna actually has a really well desgined kit that should be easy to balance, while aphelios is a complete shitshow and will be horible to balance. I really think its better for riot to just remove him from the game entierly ))"

The old masteries was too weak to have issues this big and was overall better for the game and the balance. CertainlyT's champions are in the same failure category as runes are."
1229,5e385a00841d20c9f2616bfd,"The game has improved in many ways but the level of frustratin in playing against certain champs that you can basically only kill if THEY fuck up (read the agency is overwhelmingly in their hands) is fucking awful. To me personally, overwhelming mobility has a lot to do with the problem. While Aphelios has none, his strength is reflective of what an immobile champ needs to be able to compete against such shit as Akali, Mordekaiser and the likes."
1230,5e385a00841d20c9f2616c01,"Base champion winrate is over influenced by people who are mediocre at certain champs. Azir had a 46% and he wasnt in a bad spot. Ar least when you play him you dont feel you cant do anything.

When you are playing Kaisa or Xayah you feel you  can do something vs bruisers or assassins with your R. If im playing Kalista I know 100% sure im dead"

ninja edit; I explained that really badly I realise, but when he has all 20 theyre much more compact compared to if he has half there will likely be a gap each chakram and so on, though if he ever gets to 10 I'd advise just backing off."

1241,5e385a01841d20c9f2616c2d,"Maybe we're using different definitions of ""a champion's kit""? XD

For me, any mechanic that's within the enemy skills is also part of his kit, so for example, each different combination of Primary/Secondary weapons is a different kit interaction, but you interpret it as you want. :)"
1242,5e385a01841d20c9f2616c31,"> Also I just checked, why the hell does Ornn have a 1.1 AD scaling on his q?!?!??!

No clue

Anyways, to the rest of your points, Ornn only does damage when he procs the brittle on his W or Ult, that’s where all of it comes from unless you trade into his E but that’s not exceptionally heavy damage either and it still requires you using your q first. 

His mana costs seem non existent because you can just build iceborne in lane and never worry about it."
1243,5e385a01841d20c9f2616c35,"His mana costs are fairly average, it's just that he can spend 350 buying a mana crystal in lane at any point. In many orn builds his first item is a mana item(iceborn or abyssal)."
1244,5e385a01841d20c9f2616c39,"Ornn has a ton of percent-health damage too, meaning he does damage no matter how you build him.  Oh, and his damage is mixed 60-40 physical-magic.  Because fuck you, I guess."

ofc you cannot just jump any wall and expect to live. ofc what i said was meant if a player uses his brain. You can play around everything else you mentioned (except maokai but you need like 50 of that stacked and he needs to be full ap Maokai so that is a usecases that happens once in 10k games, ergo irrelevant). You just jump a wall as sqishy if you checked the circumstances. enemies in base, dead, you see them etc. Aphelios can oneshot you even if you made all the preparations. you can literally see all 5 enemies doing Baron on a ward, walk around bluebuff and get oneshot there. no other champ can do that, no one."

Syndra R was nerfed because with some setup could oneshot almost anyone.

Aphelios is doing the same but he doesnt even need to use R and can do that without putting himself at risk"

If every champ had unique mechanics, like senna's range and attack speed scaling, aphelios's weapon swaps, pyke's health/ad scaling, akali's ""true"" stealth etc, and you had never played before, it would take you fucking years to learn how to play against them."

From there, all he did was sit on Chakram and use Severum to build the stacks by pressing Q. Severum gets used up very fast like this, and as a result, Calibrum comes online and Aphelios presses Q again.

So while this is complicated to explain, the player simply presses Q and uses auto attacks. That is not something that most would consider mechanically challenging."

First is clarity. You need to clearly know his second gun. Period. It matters a lot and it's not at all readable past lane phase in hectic teamfights. I need something displayed.

Second it doesn't seem like he has a downside other than just immobility. I know his guns do different things, but they are all OK. You aren't disadvantaged using them. Worst case is suboptimal. Never bad. Before he came out I thought he would have more trade-offs, but it doesn't seem like he has to compromise."
1285,5e385a03841d20c9f2616cdd,">I mean, he's almost literally several champions combined. He has the Ashe-stance (slow gun), he has the Caitlyn+Heimerdinger-Stance, etcetc.

Honestly, I don't think that's what makes him bad, though. Like the concept of an ADC who's good at a *little bit of everything* but excellent at nothing is a great idea on paper. Being able to swap between a weaker version of Ashe's slow and Cait's long-range attack offers some interesting play, since you're never going to be as self-peeling as Ashe nor as good with long-range DPS like Cait, but you *can* do both.

The problem is that he's got five million interactions between his ult/Q's/weapons that it's a fucking enigma to figure out what he's going to do next, and ultimately all you have to do is right click and win, which doesn't take the sort of analytical mindset that people assumed it would when they thought he would be LoL's Invoker. I think a champ that mixes watered-down versions of other champ's iconic abilities is a great idea, the execution was just completely fucked."

>Cooldown increased to 150 / 120 / 90 seconds from 120 / 90 / 60.

These are the last two non-bug fix patches that have attempted to deal with those issues. They've been trying for years.

It's hard to balance rend without setting a maximum cap on things like baron/dragon, but that doesn't even fix the problem. She'd still have an excellent secure because she effectively increases the smite in organized play. You'd have to completely remove her damage to epic monsters, which makes taking dragons/baron almost impossible as all she builds is attack speed and crit.

As for her ult saving the support too often, all they could do to fix that is either A: increase the cd and make her completely unviable because it won't be up for fights, or force the support to be out of combat, which again, makes her unviable, though this time mostly because her post-5 laning would be horrendous without a mage support who's already ahead.

That aside, her ult saving the support isn't the biggest huge issue in the highest levels of play, as you can play around a Kalista not having ult and a support being chunked. You *cannot* play around a 2K damage smite."
1287,5e385a03841d20c9f2616ce5,"We *already* have immobile champs that can still function with CertainlyT's notoriously shitty designs. Trying to justify Aphelios' overwhelming power-budget by saying 'yeah but CertainlyT also did a horrifically bad job on Akali, so it's ok' is

2. Justifying Riot continuing to release some of the worst champs in the game's history

1289,5e385a04841d20c9f2616ced,"They gain back the max HP. There's two components, reducing your HP and adding that max to Mordekaiser (going from 2000 to 1800 max HP) and both adding this 200 HP to Mordekaiser as a ""heal"" (otherwise it would be useless for Mordekaiser to jump from 3000 max hp to 3200 if you don't actually give him the HP to fill the new upper limit) and subtracting it from his target's current HP (otherwise it wouldn't deal damage if the target's current HP <90%).

Edit: This explanation was a bit messy. Mordekaiser ult does the following things:

* Set his target's max possible HP to 90% of its value. E.g. from 2000 max HP to 1800.
* Add that same amount to his own max possible HP. If Morde has 3000 HP, ulting that 2000 HP target will set his max HP to 3200.
* Deal damage to his target equal to 10% of their max HP. This is separate from the aforementioned HP total modification, so if he ults a full HP target they'll actually be dealt 20% max HP, essentially.
* Heal himself for an amount equal to 10% of his target's max HP. 

These last two bullets are not reversed when the ult ends."

But I'd argue you will take the same amount of damage from walking into a Zyra plant as you do from his turret assuming they have the same amount of gold (which rarely will be the case since Zyra is mostly played support).

Now a Zyra plant doesn't even last half as long as his turret and that's probably one of the things I'd tweak about Aphelios

1303,5e385a04841d20c9f2616d25,"I repeat once again: I didn't say a word about this champ is balanced. Yes, he's broken, yes, he lacks visual clarity, but open your goddamn eyes, he used his ult at the beginning of a clip. How it supposed to oneshot you if it's wasted already?

Ok, let's assume he have ult. He need to get out of fight and get rid of a green gun (so he loses Cait shots & safe range) or white gun (to lose turrets and most valuable 1v1 instrument in his kit). Then, after 50 autos (or 30 autos + 2 spells with 8 sec cd), his rotation will give him this terrifying blue gun. Finally!

But wait, what will you do while he's trying to find a place to waste ammo? Stand still in a group of 5, hugging each other in wait for him to oneshot you? Never look back, never place a ward? What a nice idea.

If you want to chase him, wait 5 seconds and let his stacks disappear. Then you can do whatever you want. He most likely wasted the most of white ammo during a teamfight / or to place turrets, so even if you got hit by one it won't hurt that much. Yes, you can't oneshot Aphelios for free like any other adc (like a handicapped Varus), but in fact he's just an immobile glasscannon. Which means a walking free kill. Just pick Thresh/Morgana, land your Q and he's dead. It's that simple."
1304,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d29,"I might not be better then doublelift, but I'm sure as hell smarter if he, as a pro player, seriously did not take the time to play one or two games with a new ADC in order to figure out how they work and where it's weak spots are.

Anyway, I believe that 50% of all this complaining is just a way to apologize your own mistakes. I just said I'm a silver support main. If a mediocre silver player can figure out the counterplay to this champ, then all the big brain geniuses from higher elos can do it too."
1306,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d31,"Exactly! I bought this champ on release to learn what will I fight in ranked, I've played 5 games as him and it was enough to understand what he's doing. Maybe it's because I've focused on 1 gun every game instead of playing on autopilot, but since then counterplaying wasn't hard at all. I'm actually sick of playing with adcs who find reading and learning the game such a hard option.

But yeah, better ban him in normals than watch what his kit is capable of."
1307,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d35,"It's starting to feel like the type of game I would have made up when I was like 6, just changing rules to fit my whims and make it impossible for my dad to keep up."
1308,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d39,"Alright, I agree completely with your point but it wasn't at all clear in the post I've originally replied to."
1309,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d3d,But the simpler champions aren't as strong as when Draven/Fiora are played optimally.

1311,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d45,OK necrozoophilia.
1312,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d49,"You silly billy. Yes he THROWS 20 chakrams, but it only costs 1 ammo of course."
1313,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d4d,"He uses the pistol thing first (The spinning, single target thing) which is very good at stacking chakrum

After stacking about 20 of them, he exhausted his pistol ammo and got the sniper rifle. 

This allows him to place a sniper turret and snipe senna with 20 chakrums and a calibrum shot"
1314,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d51,"Yeah they come back to him and because he has so many chakram it looks like more than just 20, and the extra chakram are fairly slow to actually land and come back if you're at a range. Depending on how many he has he does extra damage but it only takes one ammo per shot because the extra chakram are essentially just shiny looking bonus ad. Having 20 increases his total damage per auto to 173% bonus ad on top of his ad already so it can really fuckin' hurt per auto if he can freely stack it up."
1315,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d55,His autos use 1 ammo each.
1316,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d59,"When you have chakram, landing abilities on champs gives you a little chakram stacking upto max of 20 and they expire out of combat. Because of this you have to land your abilities on multiple champs and stay fighting. Each small chakram add a bit of extra damage when you basic attack"
1317,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d5d,"The number of chakram is just a damage multiplier on his attacks (like crit), thats it. Don't think of them as extra autos or ammo consuming or anything, they are just a damage multiplier from 0-173% bonus damage."
1318,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d61,The chakrams return to you duh
1319,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d65,"Ammo controls how many abilities and autos he can commit to, the extra chakrams just add extra damage on hit per auto"
1320,5e385a05841d20c9f2616d69,"Yeah, sure... Her entire design revolves around two-shoting people with the Bubble+Q.

Plus, her W is just a fiesta ability. ""Did Zoe just Flash four times in a row?"" ""Holy shit, she got Gunblade from minions and it dealt 180 damage to me at level three."" 

Also, don't forget the Teleports she got at the start...

She's an extremely poorly designed champion, she's incredibly unfun to play against and in my opinion she isn't even fun to play due to how clunky her Q feels. 

I truly thought Zoe would be the epitome of poor champion design, but boy, I was mistaken. Aphelios took that number one spot in a flash."
1321,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d6d,"She wasn't fine. Her design is still terrible.

They literally reworked Nidalee before Zoe was created for the sole reason they felt it was bad design to have a champion basically 1 shot you from ridiculous range from 1 spell. Then turn around and designed a champion with literally the same spell but worse, but then a stun on top of it."
1322,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d71,"I came from a different angle. I'm not justifying his power, I'm critizising the past designs that have lead to his power."
1323,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d75,Tier listing is a completely made up stat lol.
1324,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d79,"I dont know what a Beograd stun is and i dont care.

And about the setup, its bullshit and you know it. Syndra also needed a setup to then one shot you with a high cd, medium range ultimate and that was nerfed because it was stupid.

This is even worse than 7 spheres Syndra ult.

The mechanics are not fine, this isnt just a clarity issue (which is an issue too)"
1325,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d7d,"yeah and that is how it is supposed to be lol. An ADC should not be able to 1vs1 and assasin when both are even in Gold and Exp. He should just die. Why is that? An ADC has range and way higher DPS they can constantly apply in fights. An Assasin has to find chances and is mostly way way way worse in teamfights then any ADC. Try killing the ADC against a Leona beside him. if ADCs can now 1vs1 assasins, lol, they are busted. if vayne or Kaisa can do it, its already borderline. but imo, those go half of Aphelios range, espescially Vayne who doesnt even half a spell with real range"
1326,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d81,Because he is a mix of AD caster and auto attackers. A Jhin with better numbers.
1327,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d85,"yeah Aphelios turret should also have a mechanic that shuts it down. at the moment it has unliimited range (as in how far away it can be from  Aphelios), can deal really good damage and with the right combo of weapons you can autoattack hit opponents. Imo, it should be disabled faster (like Zyra plants) or just stop functiniong when Aphelios is not in 1000 range or something (similiar to Heimerdinger). havin it just sit around without limits while other champs do have them seems unfair"
1328,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d89,"yeah well that is what should happen to Aphelios. Weaker when played bad, better then other ADCs when played optimally. Currently he is as strong as everyone else if you play him like garbage and completely utterly broken when in the hands of someone that plays to his full potential"
1329,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d8d,"draven isn't that good right now, easier champs have a better time trying to win matches"
1330,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d91,Wait what the hell? WHY WOULD THOSE NOT COUNT AS ADDITIONAL THROWS?
1331,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d95,Brah...
1332,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d99,Holy shit I didn't realise Calibrum's mark was a passive on the weapon itself. I thought it was a part of the Q - I had no idea the Sniper Turret could trigger the mark too.
1333,5e385a06841d20c9f2616d9d,"Specifically abilities that USE the Chakram offhand, right? I.e., Gravitum Q doesn't give you little Chakrams."
1334,5e385a06841d20c9f2616da1,"Pretty much every one of those issues is a numbers issue. 

Any assassin is designed around 2-3 tapping people as their power fantasy.

Minions giving TP early isn't exclusively a numbers issue, since it needed a logic check to determine if it was late enough in the game that a TP drop was even justifiable, but still.

In order for her to flash 4 times in a fight that means either 4 actual flashes were burned, or she got a really lucky minion drop.

She's annoying, but no worse than others are/have been."
1335,5e385a06841d20c9f2616da5,CertainlyT buddy. Everything he touches is cancer.
1336,5e385a06841d20c9f2616da9,A stun that has unlimited range through walls and that leaves a trap on the ground the size of half the lane!
1337,5e385a07841d20c9f2616dad,"Except vayne has a insane late game, where after 30 ish minutes she'll be able to 1v1 every assassin in the game with ease. 

The only situation where aphelios can 1v1 a zed like this is one where the zed goes in recklessly without considering the amount of chakrums aphelios has, and frankly you deserve to lose if you go in on a aphelios with 20 stacks. Would be like going in on a illaoi just after she's ulted at full hp."
1338,5e385a07841d20c9f2616db1,"Problem is with his current kit he's either better than everyone else when played like shit because his numbers are too high, or on par with everyone else when played optimally because everything is too low."
1339,5e385a07841d20c9f2616db5,"I mean, there was a post a few months back that Aphelios had a 220% ban rate in Korean Diamond 1+ SoloQ. Yes. 220%."
1340,5e385a07841d20c9f2616db9,"Because in his abilities they are called ""ghost"" chakram IIRC"
1341,5e385a07841d20c9f2616dbd,Because they don’t deal the same damage as a normal auto. He’s not getting “20 free autos” he’s getting one auto and 20 weak ass autos that stack on hit effects.
1342,5e385a07841d20c9f2616dc1,"because he would be fucking garbage if they did, he doesn't deal 20x damage per hit"
1343,5e385a07841d20c9f2616dc5,"Cuz it is smaller and deal less dmg than the actual chakram so...

/s"
1344,5e385a07841d20c9f2616dc9,"Oh, it gets better! The Severum active (which was used to stack those chakrams) doesn't use ammo from the secondary weapon at all. Just 5 extra shots from your secondary. Same with calibrum."
1345,5e385a07841d20c9f2616dcd,"It's an excuse to give Aphelios too much power as he's a new champ and Riot hasn't met their quota for Aphelios sales. Also CertainlyT is really, *really* bad at champion design."
1346,5e385a07841d20c9f2616dd1,"No, no, the mark only applies on Calibrum's Q but Chakrum's turret will apply the mark too if it uses Calibrum's gun and autos someone

He missed his Q in the play but he had the extended range from both Calibrum's auto range and the turret later hitting Senna"
1347,5e385a07841d20c9f2616dd5,"The marks apply when you use any skill while calibrum is offhand, because all of the abilities attack with offhand"
1348,5e385a07841d20c9f2616dd9,"Any way you can do calibrum damage, aside from autoing while holding calibrum, will apply mark. 

Calibrum turret is highest powerspike of aph next to red pistol and charkrams"
1349,5e385a07841d20c9f2616ddd,"Honestly, that mark is the source of wtf for a lot of these clips that make the front page. It enables so much bullshit. I honestly hope it's removed."
1350,5e385a07841d20c9f2616de1,"I actually died to Aphelios because he somehow got the free infinite range AA on me 3 times in like 5-6 seconds at lvl 3.

I’ve never been this confused by a new champion, his outplay potential to me seems like literally kill him instantly or get fucked

I’m glad Pyke is being barely played at this point so I can just permaban that bs"
1351,5e385a07841d20c9f2616de5,"Correct, the gravitum is the only weapon which won't grant more chakrums on hit. Infernum and severum will grant the most, depending on situation"
1352,5e385a07841d20c9f2616de9,"Yes. It’s actually difficult to stack that many chakrams and not lose them. The enemy team grouped up and got smacked by aphelios’ R in a choke point which gave him a fuckton of chakrams, because he outed with chakrams out, and then he used the pistol q to stack the rest of the chakrams and got the sniper after he ran out of ammo on the pistol."
1353,5e385a07841d20c9f2616ded,"They are usually designed to do that from up close though. From what I understand a big part of the problem with Zoe kills is that they can come out of nowhere without Zoe putting herself in harms way.

With the range she has it feels more like she should be designed around being a poke champion rather than assassin. Like old Nidalee, hard to pin down and does a lot of poke damage but with little to do if she gets closed in on before having poked enough."
1354,5e385a08841d20c9f2616df1,"> In order for her to flash 4 times in a fight that means either 4 actual flashes were burned

She still flashes 4 times. That's what everyone has a problem with. Everyone else flashed once."
1355,5e385a08841d20c9f2616df5,Someone tell me why its ok for Zoe to get my spells though. Why am I being punished for using my own summs? Its shitty design.
1356,5e385a08841d20c9f2616df9,"Flash cannot drop from minions, nor has it ever been able to, for her to flash 4 times, she would need 3 shards and her own or 4 shards"
1357,5e385a08841d20c9f2616dfd,[deleted]
1358,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e01,So youre literally supposed to click the champ before the fight and check how many stacks of something he has? Thats ridiculous and most of the time physically impossible in the middle of a fight.
1359,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e05,"yeah i do think balancing him will probably be very hard. something like Draven would probably get stuff done, where the difference in numbers between Axes and no axes is just huge. however, that would make Aphelios useless when not played optimally and he would probably disapper from every elo except master+ which would suck the same.

and if you just balance all numbers, well, it wouldnt matter much playing him optimally or not then so skill expression would be gone :/"
1360,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e09,That has to be a joke lmfao
1361,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e0d,And patch notes call them mini Chakrams.
1362,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e11,"They don't stack on hit effects ffs, they just make his autos do extra damage."
1363,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e15,Pretty sure its 9 extra shots because all of his Qs cost ten primary ammo.
1364,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e19,Yeah you lost me. And I'm in school to get my doctorates.
1365,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e1d,"No the mark is a passive part of the sniper. If the sniper is at any point your secondary it marks an enemy champion on which you can follow it up. Does it for the pistol q, does it for turrets from chakras, does it from the flamethrower q. It’s just part of the sniper. 


Like the character is grossly overpowered right now but no one seems to have even read what his abilities do or at least played him once. He’s not hard to figure out what he’s doing. What’s hard is to notice what his secondary gun is and it’s ammo count."
1366,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e21,I honestly still dont get it? Is there a simpler way of explaining just what is going on? I really can't get my head round some of this champions interactions?
1367,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e25,"Well, yes, that's why they ***finally*** nerfed her.

IMO the only change she actually needs is something like hard CC stopping her ult from returning her, or at least only knockup/displacement stopping it."
1368,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e29,"I will agree that it's a dumb meme, and they should probably be weaker versions, but it's really not *that* bad."
1369,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e2d,Chunking someone for half to three quarters of their health is pretty fucking impactful if you're in a rank above bronze.
1370,5e385a08841d20c9f2616e31,Thats... not true at all. Most of the champions have gone by the way side but poke and seige comps can be and still are a thing. The idea behind them is just whittling down or.chunking out people so they need to concede objectives if they dont want to die and give them up anyway. They lose to engage or sustain. It's not ine shot or.be useless when you treat health as a proper resource.
1371,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e35,"No, it's SUPER fucking obvious, like in the above clip, you can see the chakrums swirling around aphelios the whole time. Simple as this, you see more then maybe 3? Don't go in on him 1v1, you'll probably lose."
1372,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e39,"Nah, basically everytime you use an ability it stacks them giving you autos additional damage on top of the dps increasing the closer you are to a target"
1373,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e3d,You get five shots of your secondary in exchange for five shots of Severum. I could have phrased that better
1374,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e41,"Ok yeah, you're right lol

I mean knowing that his sniper passive is part of the gun's overall passive doesn't change how you play against him"
1375,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e45,"It's simple really, every third step aph takes is added to a quadratic formula that's inversely proportional to 0.76 AD that his chakram gives, every time you auto with the chakram it builds a blade, when you switch to his sixth weapon and use the secondary it drops a turret that autos every odd second unless they are parallel to the turret then it's every second.

Now the secondary of the turret activates a passive marker that when you switch back to his sniper and use that secondary it activates the mark and uses the chakrams at an exponential rate."
1376,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e49,"So the Chakram thing makes mini chakrams if your other weapon uses an ability (Doesn't work with Gravitum since Gravitum doesn't use off hand, but you don't need to remember that). These mini charkams can stack upto 20 and do extra scaling damage when you auto

Chakram ability is placing a turret that holds the other gun

If you other gun is the sniper, then it creates a turret with extra range and marks targets that it autos.

Sniper marks work the same way as the sniper's ability, you can proc it to auto from anywhere.

Since you're auto'ing, all your chakrams fly towards them"
1377,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e4d,"Fair enough, never played him myself so I`m still utterly in the dark on what he does."
1378,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e51,Ah makes sense. Thanks for clarifying
1379,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e55,I mean it kinda does. You can tank his chakram turrets as long as it's not the sniper/grav cannon. That's the whole point.
1380,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e59,Wow you should have said so earlier
1381,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e5d,This champion needs to be reworked lmao
1382,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e61,"See then I get why you don't get what he does, however a pro player such as rush has no excuses for not knowing what every champion does. Even I do and I'm gold 4.

Also just a tip, use free champ weeks to your advantage to get to know champions you don't own, it helps a lot when trying to play against them."
1383,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e65,removed. Just take him out and release 4 champs with his kit.
1384,5e385a09841d20c9f2616e69,Yea i try to do that but i usually only play aram because summoners rift is always such a cancerous experience. Its harder to get the champ you want there for obvious reasons
1385,5e385a27841d20c9f2616e6e,But I thought Zven was TSMs problem.
1386,5e385a27841d20c9f2616e72,Simply impressive stats. I hope he'll keep his form up until the end of season.

1394,5e385a28841d20c9f2616e92,"This is what Niels/Zven was in OG and G2, and what he was supposed to be in TSM. I will never blame Regi for picking him up over Doublelift, it always made sense in paper imo.

I really wonder if he can outperform DL this split. He almost did it in Spring 2018 (regular split, not playoffs obviously), but DL just seems invincible ever since CoreJJ joined TL. Exciting times ahead"

That's just my opinion from the outside ofc, I have no idea what goes on behind close doors, but the staff turnover seems pretty high, other then Bjerg who is kept around for branding and his cs per minute lane kingdom."

1406,5e385a29841d20c9f2616ec2,"Ok, Zven is really good, and I am fully onboard the C9 hype train, their team cohesion is actually fucking ridiculous, like they seem to be fully functioning on the exact same page all the time, they already look like a good mid late season team.  Really impressive how synced up everyone is.  That said.  No other team in the LCS looks like they are even LCS ready, aside from maybe Dignitas, which seem like a good early season team.  So while its great Zven has such good stats, its not like he has any sort of competition what so ever."

1417,5e385a29841d20c9f2616eee,It’s funny how much happier Zven and Sven look in their headshots after leaving TSM for C9.
1418,5e385a29841d20c9f2616ef2,seems like a solid pick up over that Snacky guy
1419,5e385a29841d20c9f2616ef6,"Zven is and always has been an amazing ADC. Very consistent, a team player and very very good.   
Having to play with Bjergsen is pure shi\*.   
Bjergsen is a pain in the ass. He should leave for TSM good."
1420,5e385a29841d20c9f2616efa,"When an European player goes to America just to play on his smurf account. Zven is a fckn monster, since Origen times!"
1421,5e385a2a841d20c9f2616efe,"Still a majority of the split left. Let’s not discredit his success so far, but also keep in mind there’s a long way to go."
1422,5e385a2a841d20c9f2616f02,Zven had great stats when he joined TSM too guys. It wasnt until playoffs that he made a few misplays that fans started declaring he was the problem.
1423,5e385a2a841d20c9f2616f06,He's also been playing Senna who doesn't die.

1426,5e385a2a841d20c9f2616f12,"Funny that so many people wanted Zven and C9 to fail because of what they ""did"" to Sneaky."
1427,5e385a2a841d20c9f2616f16,Not getting hindered by constant shitty TSM drafts is going to help any player succeed.
1428,5e385a2a841d20c9f2616f1a,"Do people forget he was pretty good in spring too until playoffs came where he threw the series? His problem is performing in high stakes matches like playoffs and gauntlet, let's not act like he's gotten so much better after leaving TSM yet, it's only been 2 regular season weeks."
1429,5e385a2a841d20c9f2616f1e,"The shot isn't blaming him for their failures, its an example of a roster that didn't work and a team where they didn't manage to get much done, it's not one or two peoples fault its the team as a whole, they just used the shot to emphasize the roster.

Or they just hate Zven because he was garbage and fed every other game and he was the reason they lost every game. /s"

1432,5e385a2a841d20c9f2616f2a,Yeah but his DPM is for sure lower than sneakys from worlds
1433,5e385a2a841d20c9f2616f2e,"It’s almost as if TSM takes great players, forces them to play around their style -killing the player’s identity, then spits them out for other teams to pick them up and let them perform the way they performed to make TSM want them in the first place.

See all TSM junglers and ADCs."
1434,5e385a2a841d20c9f2616f32,"My boyfriend, who never played LoL or watched LCS, really enjoy Zven's Senna's ultimates that snipe enemy team more than one screen away."
1435,5e385a2a841d20c9f2616f36,"TSM should play around botlane but the take thier name too literally. They have had world class adc's and then proceeding to do nothing with them.

Even with DL I cant remember them actually playing through botlane. It has almost always been pick a safe botlane or just have the best botlane and then play through mid top or jg.

Now that is not to say tsm is solely at fault here. Zven probably had a large part to do with the number of games played on ezreal.  And after being made trash from the removal of klepto zven has to play something else which is probably a good thing for him.  Aphelios and Senna both being immobile means he probably realizes he can't solo face check in game 5 of a finals.  Not to mention by also not having xayah be a huge part of the meta we won't see many feather storms thrown in the wrong direction now either."
1436,5e385a2a841d20c9f2616f3a,"Not surprising, EU players in NA are basically smurfing"

1440,5e385a2b841d20c9f2616f4a,"I wish this subreddit understood basic statistics and didn't draw all these conclusions based on 2 weekends of play. 

TL doesn't even have their main roster yet. Lots of experimentation going on. Let's not forget that this whole split is basically meaningless anyway. 

If Zven has a bad game next week the whole narrative will change. But if you look at his whole career, he's a upper tier ADC but still far from world class compared to other regions."
1441,5e385a2b841d20c9f2616f4e,he has this kda within the context of this current meta where it is literally impossible to die when your team plays well and the current level of NA LCS is garbage
1442,5e385a2b841d20c9f2616f52,"TSM fans ""They were never the best in the west, just here for the paycheck lol"". While I agree that Zven and Mithy sometimes just straight up ran it down, there has to be a reason for that. How did cloud 9 manage to turn him around? Did they turn him around or are there other reasons for his comeback? And why wasn't TSM able to do this too? These are the questions TSM fans should ask themselves and their staff"
1443,5e385a2b841d20c9f2616f56,"I really don't think pre 15 minute stats of side laners matter at all in the current meta (at least in NA) given doublelifts comments in today's interview. Well maybe the 10-15 minute mark I can see argument for but pre 10 is more a representation of the draft than the actual skill of the laners since leona/braum/nautilus/tahm/senna/doran stacking/that one sona game just make pre 10 laning phase totally irrelevant (and the occasional xayah/rakan) . It's all about the 8 minute herald rotation which c9 caught onto and mastered faster than the other teams. Laner stats are based on draft and team skill, not really the individual player. Only the level 3 jungle gank is where players get to shine and once that window is closed the game just becomes systematic. This meta sucks, particularly in NA. 

The KDA is damn impressive though. Well done by zven for sure. This meta suits him and he slots in exceptionally well with this c9 roster."
1444,5e385a2b841d20c9f2616f5a,Very impressive. Can't wait for 4 weeks from now when he has some bad games and this post is forgotten.
1445,5e385a2b841d20c9f2616f5e,"WELL YES OFCOURSE HE HAS NOW THAT HE'S NOT ON TSM ANYMORE.

So fucking dumb, where was this Zven in TSM huh? Time to deliver now Zven is it?"
1446,5e385a2b841d20c9f2616f62,"Clearly the amount of solokills for a botlaner is a very impressive stats, very cool :). Have rewatched them, definitely finishing off a 100 hp aatrox because he overextended after a gank from his team, and chasing down and killing a thresh at the side of a teamfight his team was stomping are very relevant informations about his skills !!

He is clearly stomping right now, but please don't use shit stats like this one, it only throws shade on him."
1447,5e385a2b841d20c9f2616f66,"Sneaky will and always will be one of the greatest ADCs NA produced but in recent years I do believe Sneaky has not been performing to the standards or expectations from what is expected of a good ad carry. For example, during 2019 Spring Sneaky had 8.9 CSM and 8.5 during the Summer. In comparison, Zven had 9.5 CSM at Spring with 9.1 CSM at Summer.  (Doublelift had highest CSM at 10.3 during Spring, Cody Sun had highest CSM at 9.5 during Summer)

No offense to Sneaky, but his stats are what I will expect from a player in a low-tier team and even if these stats difference may be small, it will be substantial against top-tier teams.                                                                                                                                                                         If we want to compare CSD@15, Sneaky had an average of -6 CSD@15 while Zven had +2 CSD@15 during Spring. During Summer, Sneaky had an average of -6 CSD@15 while Zven had -7 [CSD@15](mailto:CSD@15). (Stats are at [gol.gg](https://gol.gg))                                                                                                                               However Sneaky was on Cloud 9 who reached 2nd place in Spring and Summer while Zven was on TSM who reached third and fourth place in Spring and Summer. Shouldn't it be obvious which player should receive higher expectations on their level of performance in pro play? Even in recent times, there are memes about ""Sneaky in lane,"" popularized by Doublelift in 2016 who said Sneaky is trash in lane (but good in teamfights) and to some extent there is some truth in what Doublelift says.

There may be a bit of recency bias here, but I do believe Zven will be a better mechanical player and most consistent than Sneaky, because Zven has always been regarded as a top tier adc (during his G2 and Origen years) by many pros which tells you something about his mechanical prowess while also showing an insane work ethic. In S9, Zven has played around 1806 games in NA solo que ([https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9%20Zven](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9%20Zven)) while Sneaky has played around 1262 games ([https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+Sneaky](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+Sneaky) including his smurf C9 Gun). During S9, Zven has around 1439 games played in S9 while Sneaky has around 1200 games. Also these are just the amount of Solo q games he has played in NA. Zven also has a EUW account ([https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+ZV3N](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=C9+ZV3N)) where he played around 403 games in S8 and around 270 games in S9. Even if C9 does poorly in some games, I don't think it will stop them from being a potentially top 3 team (most likely top 2 as they always had in the past) in NA as they have such a strong showing in the first two weeks with good chemistry and macro play and I believe that Zven will perform consistently well in his future games at C9.

TLDR: Zven has always been a consistent and good mechanical ad carry even with his mishaps at TSM."
1448,5e385a2b841d20c9f2616f6a,"The year is 202X. After a decade of trophy-less splits, Regi finally uses his ultimate move, a suicide attack of sorts. Bjergsen had demanded - no, begged him to reconsider. But in that forlorn TSM house, empty save for Regi and Bjerg, the former team owner just just put his hand on his son's shoulder, and with sad eyes said, ""fuck it, baylife"". He put a slip of paper into Bjergsen's hands, then walked out the door.

That was the last Bjergsen ever saw of Reginald.

That was then, this is now. Bjergsen checks and rechecks the address Regi had handed him - his last gift. He looks back up, takes a deep breath...

Bjergsen walks up the sidewalk and knocks on the door. It opens. Bjerg gasps. No matter how many times he's seen her, the woman's beauty always leaves him breathless.

""I've been expecting you"", Sneaky says, and Bjergsen enters the C9 house.

Sneaky leads Bjergsen through the hall, down a staircase, into the deep dark pits of the cellar. Their in the darkness are three chairs, and 2 men.

""Doublelift?"" Bjergsen is confused. ""But the curse...""

Doublelift raises his eyes to meet Bjergen's gaze. ""...if never winning the split again is the price I must pay, I will gladly take it."" Bjergsen nods in understanding. He was prepared to make the same sacrifice.

They both turn to the third man.

Reapered sits, a human face so clearly housing something more than human. His eyes are deep and void, a window into the mind full of forbidden draft technologies and butthole jokes in broken English. ""Are you ready?""

""Yes"", C9's new mid and bot say in unison.

""Then let us begin"".

NA's road to a World cup begins here."

1451,5e385a2b841d20c9f2616f76,Yeah but it’s the lcs so it’s not competitive and it isn’t important to the pro scene 😂😂
1452,5e385a2b841d20c9f2616f7a,It will be even funnier if the exact same thing will happen to Kobbe in TSM after a great season in EU.

>One other thing I want to say is that I think people should stop s******g on TSM just because C9 is doing well. I did my fair part of blaming TSM, but a lot of TSM's failures in these past two years were my fault as well. It's not like it was only everyone else's fault just because I am playing well right now.
 

>All I'm trying to say is: Don't get on TSM just because I'm doing well. On my twitter posts, I see people making TSM jokes, and when I was on TSM, I hated that people would make fun of us at any and all opportunities. Regardless of whether you are a TSM fan or not, don't come to my twitter or any of my profiles to make fun of them just because I'm doing well. You can say 'congratulations' without flaming TSM."

Edit: to clarify he definetly had some pretty weak performances on TSM, it was ok to doubt him this off-season, now I hope that he will keep up with this performance and show to NA fans why he was such a big name between 2015 and 2017"

1469,5e385a2c841d20c9f2616fbe,Zven was pretty damn bad when he was in tsm. Easy to look good when your team is doing great. Hence why Pob seems so damn good when he was in TL and fell off once he’s not.
1470,5e385a2c841d20c9f2616fc2,He wanted to leave when mithy did but they kept him in contract prison

1485,5e385a2d841d20c9f2616ffe,"I guess bjerg is team's only problem. All of his championships before were just carried by dyrus and doublelift! Yup, they're all invalidated because zven played well for 2 weeks this season"

1489,5e385a2e841d20c9f261700e,This is exactly what they did to sneaky. Everyone said “oh he’s not doing anything impressive but he’s still winning so” even though his stats were good. I don’t think he got the recognition he deserved.
1490,5e385a2e841d20c9f2617012,"C9 won because Zven has been immaculate so far. 

If he had only 0 death but terrible laning and dmg stats, then your argument would make sense.

  But in the case of Zven, he is carrying C9 really hard and has been a huge rock for them.

4 games is statistically relevant. It's one game away from 1/4 of the split."
1491,5e385a2e841d20c9f2617016,People forget that Zven and Mithy's first split on TSM looked quite good until they hit playoffs and were terrible vs Clutch
1492,5e385a2e841d20c9f261701a,"Yeah. The reason teams win is because players do good... which Zven did. 

Your sentence reads like winning doesn’t take effort from the players lol"
1493,5e385a2e841d20c9f261701e,So we should just disregard games already played? Gotcha

1512,5e385a2f841d20c9f261706a,Bjergsen is the ultimate gaslighter. He contributes so much to a negative team atmosphere and toxic work environment but everyone that worked with him praises superficial aspects of his work ethic. They judge everyone else by the metrics that Bjergsen is exemplary in and place 0 value on what other people bring to the table. His fragile ego and victim mentality are hard to overcome given his childhood experiences and it's baffling to see TSM all-in on this guy even harder when they've already tried everything except switch out the mid laner since 2014.
1513,5e385a2f841d20c9f261706e,"> His problem is performing in high stakes matches like playoffs and gauntlet

I disagree, still having a vivid memory of the legendary OG vs FNC/Niels vs Rekless regional finals back in the day. Zven/Niels carried OG there, in a way I've barely ever seen since. They still lost, but I wouldn't say he has a problem performing in high stakes matches."
1514,5e385a2f841d20c9f2617072,"So you think a player has a problem performing in high stakes games because of a single mistake in a single playoff game? Yeah, let's just ignore the rest of his career or even the rest of the games in that same series."
1515,5e385a2f841d20c9f2617076,"Also if you watch the video Bjergsen saying they have had failures literally started with a shot of him and BB.

People are just looking for reasons to hate on TSM with this.

If you want to argue that TSM ruined Zven whatever, I think he is playing great right now so I get why people will make that statement. But that screenshot is misleading bullshit."
1516,5e385a2f841d20c9f261707a,This is a pretty cyclic argument. It could be said that the reason c9 is doing so well is because of the success of their bot lane.
1517,5e385a2f841d20c9f261707e,This is a fallacy. Judging players when they're on good teams is still perfectly reasonable lmao
1518,5e385a2f841d20c9f2617082,This. You wanna know how good a player is? Look at him when he’s on a bad or average team
1519,5e385a2f841d20c9f2617086,"What's funny is the start of the statement is Bjerg and BB on screen.  

I don't mind a player shitting on another team, but Licorice really reached with that tweet and people are running with it.

Zven even has a new interview asking people not to shit on TSM simply because he is doing well on C9 right now."
1520,5e385a2f841d20c9f261708a,"He has played 4 games while being on the best team. It is far too early to be making claims like ""he has turned it around"". You know when zven poor positioning really showed its cracks? In playoffs where he failed to dodge  thresh hooks and positioned poorly near baron pit, and that was not TSM coachings fault. Let's wait until he does work there before we claim TSM was the issue. This happens every time TSM drops someone, aside from DL no one dropped has won domestically like they did with TSM. It is too early to see where zven will go even if he is having a incredible split so far."
1521,5e385a2f841d20c9f261708e,He doesn't have to try risky plays now that he has teammates and management he trusts and they trust him
1522,5e385a2f841d20c9f2617092,"I think the major problem with Sneaky wasnt Sneaky, or ZZ, it was the way those 2 synergized, more specifically, the sheer lack of any sort of synergy what so ever.  Have you ever just watched them play together?  Like it was rough, almost every time Sneaky went agro ZZ backed off, and everytime ZZ went agro Sneaky hesitated and went back in half a second too late.  Like, it was crinhe worthy to see them play, even if they had a lead, they just couldnt keep it, theyd lose the second Scen and Nisqy left the lane, and Licorice would TP bot and get nothing, while losing his lead top.     Like shit was really rough.

Zven and Vulcan are not just great players, but they are also incredibly in sync with one another, they hhave fantastic synergy with eachother and the team, and thats whats making it work soooo well."
1523,5e385a30841d20c9f2617096,Wasn't there 100 threads about his one misposition versus TL? Also there were mutiple threads with Chovy's KDA so I think Zven deserved one aswell.
1524,5e385a30841d20c9f261709a,"3/4 games..... The same Senna DL feels is trash in landing phase and the same Senna nobody else in NA knows wtf to do with when they get her.

Also the same Senna that Forg1ven looks like a Bronze 4 on.

What's your point?"
1525,5e385a30841d20c9f261709e,"Yes, he plays meta champs. Practices them, too."
1526,5e385a30841d20c9f26170a2,"Also aphelios. 

Not like his prime wasnt him abusing Kalista when she was OP. 

But hey if you can adapt well, that made you a great player."
1527,5e385a30841d20c9f26170a6,Imagine story line of TSM kicking DL who ends up winning 4 titles in row. Then possibly Zven winning now that he got kicked out of TSM. Lastly we just wait Kobbe to make great success after getting kicked out.
1528,5e385a30841d20c9f26170aa,"> a great season

Season? Seasons."
1529,5e385a30841d20c9f26170ae,"It is bound to happen tbh. Kobbe might've had a great season in EU, but he has very clear weaknesses since he basically entered the scene. Mainly his laning phase and his below average wave management. Biofrost isn't a player that's gonna fix your waves the way Norskeren does (I know it's trendy to hate on Norskeren for whatever reason, but somehow Kobbe didn't really shine the way he did last year, and certainly wasn't in contention for top adc in EU until he got paired with Norskeren, so food for thought for Norskeren haters), meaning he's gonna look significantly worse on TSM this year than he did last year on Splyce. Zven also had much higher peaks than Kobbe, and his wave management is actually top notch. Besides, TSM has a knack for being unable to utilize their players properly. It's not only junglers."
1530,5e385a30841d20c9f26170b2,"2021: Thank you Brokenblade, Dardoch, Kobbe, and Biofrost."
1531,5e385a30841d20c9f26170b6,I swear every time Zven has an interview I respect him more each time. He just comes across as super professional. So happy with our roster right now.
1532,5e385a30841d20c9f26170ba,Where did he say this?
1533,5e385a30841d20c9f26170be,"Yeah the TSM bashing has gotten so old. They're my teams rival ffs and still I look at the flame they get and scratch my head.

They aren't doing well, sure. People can talk about that all they want. But focus on Zven's success, not the team he was previously on."
1534,5e385a30841d20c9f26170c2,"You'd think this is fucking obvious but it's sadly not when you read comments about some players on this sub. Whenever a player dips in performance people start jerking off about how ""this is why i said he always sucked"" like you had a point because you called him bad 4 years ago when he was actually really good (or vice versa).

Player who underperformed starts performing well --> ""He was always really good his team held him down and you're all biased""

Player who performed well starts underperforming --> ""Super overrated player, definitely carried by his team. He was never good"""
1535,5e385a30841d20c9f26170c6,The biggest example ever is probably Smeb.
1536,5e385a30841d20c9f26170ca,"People seem to forget that there were games where Zven was randomly dying as Ezreal being caught out of position. As a TSM fan I'm glad to see him doing better, but it's also infuriating how suddenly everyone seems to love him when this subreddit was hellbent on blaming everything on him before as well."
1537,5e385a30841d20c9f26170ce,"Unfortunately this is way too much of an reasonable take for this sub, obviously there has to be some evil mastermind behind the scenes that forces players to be shit, extra easy upvotes when that evil mastermind happens to be TSM, if half the shit that people are spouting on this sub was true then no single player would even want to play for this org again yet they still do, weird huh"
1538,5e385a30841d20c9f26170d2,"This take works in 99% of cases, but haven't we seen enough underperforming performances from players on TSM, who then suddenly has a good season when they leave, to make the original take relevant and feasible?"
1539,5e385a30841d20c9f26170d6,"But it doesn’t look good for TSM when those slumps are always when the players are on their team, and they immediately get out of the slump after."
1540,5e385a30841d20c9f26170da,And Kobbe next
1541,5e385a31841d20c9f26170de,who is our Ed Woodward
1542,5e385a31841d20c9f26170e2,"Mate don't do that to me......   
Why do I have to be a loyal fan. GGMU."
1543,5e385a31841d20c9f26170e6,"As a tsm and united fan, this hurts. Alexis Sanchez, di maria, even lukaku were terrible at United then rediscovered thier form after leaving. Ed woodward is a pos though. Only cares about $$ not results"
1544,5e385a31841d20c9f26170ea,"After C9's decision to put newbie Licorice and washed off Sven, I had no doubts that Zven would do well in C9. I was still wrong. He is stellar on C9."
1545,5e385a31841d20c9f26170ee,"I'm a huge fan of Zven, but Zven is at best a side-grade to DL."
1546,5e385a31841d20c9f26170f2,"It's a given at this point, even when we win it's more about how garbage we are."
1547,5e385a31841d20c9f26170f6,"Zven wasn't ""fine"" he performed really poorly individually on TSM and admitted that himself when he joined C9. He was very vocal about how shit his performance has been since coming to NA.

Player performances can vary. Just because he's playing well now it doesn't mean he's always played well and always will play well."
1548,5e385a31841d20c9f26170fa,We've had the same one player for the past couple of failed splits.......He may not perform poorly but if he's the voice of the team and when the team keeps playing the same way its clear that's the way HE wants to play........and its not working........You know who im talking about
1549,5e385a31841d20c9f26170fe,"It's actually parth

You overestimate how much Regi is involved with the team at this point save for last Summer"
1550,5e385a31841d20c9f2617102,"It's also easy to look bad when you're team is doing bad. Hence why Froggen wasn't doing well on several NA teams but he seems to be back in form on dignitas. 

Also, hence why Zven looked bad on TSM even though he was the main carry of several very successful EU teams. 

Not saying you're wrong to say what you're saying. I'm just saying it goes both ways."
1551,5e385a31841d20c9f2617106,"Then you realise C9 as individuals aren't actually great.

Nisqy is a very average mid laner even in NA, same for Blabber as a jungler. Licorice is a good NA top laner but still not very good when you consider the rest of the world, Vulcan is probably their second best player after Zven.

The difference with C9 is they have a really good coach who seems to know how to get his points across and get the team playing basic macro really well for the whole game, something most NA teams can't do.


Zven had some notable errors on TSM but I put that down to him trying to carry too hard because he knew his team was useless."
1552,5e385a31841d20c9f261710a,"Mithy, Hauntzer, MikeYeung, Akaadian, Grig, and Spica all joined and left during the last two years and that is not including the coaching staff, don't think you can expect anyone to look good when they are part of the TSM shit show."
1553,5e385a31841d20c9f261710e,He was never bad. He was inconsistent but at worst was middle of the table and towards the end of the year in S9 gauntlet he was easily their best player.
1554,5e385a31841d20c9f2617112,"It goes both ways, it's easy to look bad when your team is playing like bunch of apes, you become emotional, lose focus and start playing like ape yourself. I fully agree that Zven played like shit in TSM, but that doesn't make him a bad player."
1555,5e385a31841d20c9f2617116,"So, they held him to obligations he willing accepted per the legal document he signed in exchange for money?  Is that what you are referring to as 'contract prison?'"
1556,5e385a31841d20c9f261711a,Talent Suppression Machine KEKW
1557,5e385a31841d20c9f261711e,"I think its just the difference between having a good coach and staff like C9 is known for, and whatever the fuck TSM has going on"
1558,5e385a31841d20c9f2617122,"Considering how good zven was on og and g2, it's way more likely this is the case.

Although in my opinion, I always thought that Zven was really good, even when he was on tsm."
1559,5e385a32841d20c9f2617126,Imagine if Bjergsen would become unshackled from the TSM debuff and joined C9. He would be unstopable.
1560,5e385a32841d20c9f261712a,Truly the Man Utd of league
1561,5e385a32841d20c9f261712e,"You say this, but Sven sucks now he's in EG."
1562,5e385a32841d20c9f2617132,"Sven has been running it down in EG btw

Contractz looked like a good jungler in C9 btw

Not sure when people will realise that Reapered is by far the best coach in the league and can make any player look really good"
1563,5e385a32841d20c9f2617136,"It’s definitely a TSM debuff more than a C9 buff, Zven was also this dominant before he joined TSM"
1564,5e385a32841d20c9f261713a,"C9 buffs their players, so they can sell them with profit"
1565,5e385a32841d20c9f261713e,C9 hasn't won LCS since 2014 TSM hasn't made it out of groups at worlds since 2014. A soul for a soul.
1566,5e385a32841d20c9f2617142,"At least they can get out of groups at worlds.

Also theyre consistently top 2-3 natively."
1567,5e385a32841d20c9f2617146,"still more worlds success then doublelift, who plays since season 1, btw."
1568,5e385a32841d20c9f261714a,"People list Svenskeren as someone ""held down by TSM"" when he was VASTLY more successful on TSM than he ever was on C9 (or any other team he's been part of for that matter)"
1569,5e385a32841d20c9f261714e,Yet they're the only NA team to consistently make it out of groups while DL can't do shit.
1570,5e385a32841d20c9f2617152,"I really hope he'd return one day, if not in EUW at least in NA and possibly join top orgs like C9/TSM and potentially reach further in worlds"
1571,5e385a32841d20c9f2617156,"Bjerg could now easily take a shit on his keyboard during the game and Regi would say eh sumimasen Bjerg-san, that not good but ok i love you still."
1572,5e385a32841d20c9f261715a,Maybe because they don't want to burn any bridges?
1573,5e385a32841d20c9f261715e,"This is pure logic: TSM's problems must come from their common denominators over all these years, both team and staff. These are not only Bjerg, but him and/or the other common denominators possibly cause the TSM culture and chronic issues.

Pros talking well about others is just courtesy, specially if Bjerg is a good person/friend, they're not gonna shit on him for his issues as a player."
1574,5e385a32841d20c9f2617162,"Maybe it's because Reddit says Bjerg is afraid to take risks and make plays, and his former teammates say he's really nice and hardworking, and that both can be true?!"
1575,5e385a32841d20c9f2617166,"""He has a very particular way he thinks the game should be played"" is not a praise. Stop it."
1576,5e385a32841d20c9f261716a,No one is invalidating his previous championships.
1577,5e385a33841d20c9f261716e,"That's a fairly common trend, the horror stories of TSM fans tend to be perpetrated more by the illusion that they shit on their own team constantly."
1578,5e385a33841d20c9f2617172,"Most TSM fans still wants Zven to do well, he was a great guy and it was just unlucky how it didn't work out for him. He didnt like NA at first, had the worst series of his career against CG, mental went boom, fucked up against TL, mental went boom. Unlucky...change of environment + Reapered helped him a lot."
1579,5e385a33841d20c9f2617176,Honestly I was pretty shocked the amount of support Zven got as compared to other TSM players who weren't looking too hot.
1580,5e385a33841d20c9f261717a,"Honestly I want zven to find success in na but at this point I hope he doesn't only because c9 players and fans are acting like little bitches and like they are hot shit. Sorry c9, when's the last time you won LCS or... won anything...? And I still think the org did sneaky dirty. IDC what anyone says, for sneaky to not find a team, completely disconnect from c9 and only stream now, some shady shit went down."
1581,5e385a33841d20c9f261717e,"Sneaky's stats before 15 min were terrible last season. Lots of factors play in besides his play, but lets not pretend he was great."
1582,5e385a33841d20c9f2617182,"I am on the Zven hype train like many others(I've supported him since day 1 on C9), and he is doing fucking fantastic, but he isn't hard carrying C9 as weird as that might sound. Literally everyone on the team is pulling their weight and above it. C9 as a team is hard carrying each other. I can't even pinpoint a weak point right now, other than some very minor stuff like Licorice(he disrespected Hauntzer lvl 5 and got killed for it) or Blaber(he got caught out a bit vs 100T) misplaying a play or two."
1583,5e385a33841d20c9f2617186,"> 4 games is statistically relevant. 


Lol no."
1584,5e385a33841d20c9f261718a,It reads like 4 games is not many.
1585,5e385a33841d20c9f261718e,no one said that
1586,5e385a33841d20c9f2617192,"Imports are a problem. The shit imports, that is. NA focuses too much on name value. Then there’s IMT with the nepotism. Only 11 imports in the league actually deserve their slot, excluding the ones who’ve obtained residency (Impact, Jensen, and Bjergsen). 

NA has terrible coaching staff as well, barring C9. Look at how C9’s always consistently top 2-3 every fucking year, but the players who leave C9 proceed to perform gradually worse and worse. The exception is Impact, I guess. 

The problem honestly stems from coaching. After all, management decides rosters."
1587,5e385a33841d20c9f2617196,4 good games doesn't change the fact that he was garbage for 2 years straight and single handedly cost his team a championship
1588,5e385a33841d20c9f261719a,How so? He legit played like shit and lost the finals for the team. I agree that tsm makes players play bad but that's for junglers only. He had bad positioning and poor mechanics and he himself agrees with that. I'm a g2 fan and I know what zven is capable of but his performance on tsm was poor shit and it's wasn't anyone's fault but his
1589,5e385a33841d20c9f261719e,"Zven wasnt even bad on tsm tho? Sure, it's easy to point out the flashy misplays but overall he was pretty consistently good on tsm. The entire last split the whole team was in turmoil but are we forgetting zven and tsm did make it to finals...? Sure they lost but it's not like they were garbage the whole time."
1590,5e385a33841d20c9f26171a2,"It was more a testament to players who leave TSM for C9 reaching new (or existing) heights.

Agree the TSM effect does bring down the overall quality of any player."
1591,5e385a34841d20c9f26171a6,"Keith, Zeyzal, smoothie, stunt,  etc


It's incredible how bad the support pool is for LCS.

 Outside of the 2 koreans Core and Ignar and the Canadian Vulcan, the rest is either okayish (bio and sometimes Aphro) or garbage."
1592,5e385a34841d20c9f26171aa,Sneaky was apart of the problem. Sneaky never went to bootcamp alone with his support
1593,5e385a34841d20c9f26171ae,"It's actually pretty weird, the first split each time C9 has had a new support they mostly absolutely shit on everyone, but the split after they just fall off the face of the earth, both smoothie and zeyzal had incredible first showings on C9, but somehow, just start playing so much worse."
1594,5e385a34841d20c9f26171b2,He didn't go bootcamp with any of his supports though.
1595,5e385a34841d20c9f26171b6,"Forreal. Like Kobbe is still playing really well on TSM, but there is no cohesion with the team/drafts making no sense"
1596,5e385a34841d20c9f26171ba,So we are just going to ignore the fact that he's laning with the best support in the league or the #2 depending on who you ask + a competent jg. Smoothie and TSM's jg issues dragged down Zven.
1597,5e385a34841d20c9f26171be,"They fire coaches just as frequently as they fire players, all of their coaches suck too?"
1598,5e385a34841d20c9f26171c2,"Not disagreeing with you, in fact I agree with the statement, but I would be equally as impressed if you told me the opposite, but about 2015-17 Zven and 2018-2019 Kobbe. When Zven left G2 he was the single best adc in Europe and by default the best in the west. Kobbe was regarded as a top 3/4 adc in Europe (Upset, Perkz, Rekkles). Obviously we have to consider each player's current performance, but Zven's peak, regardless of how you rank Kobbe's last year, was clearly higher. Considering TSM's history I don't think this development is surprising at all."
1599,5e385a34841d20c9f26171c6,You mean Mithy?
1600,5e385a34841d20c9f26171ca,He was thought to be a sidegrade with Mithy over Bio due to being a shotcaller which they wanted
1601,5e385a34841d20c9f26171ce,"literally 3 years ago

that is not a valid argument"
1602,5e385a34841d20c9f26171d2,"I'm not saying Kobbe's better, but you cannot base your argumentation on games that were played 3 years ago."

1604,5e385a34841d20c9f26171da,especially the fact that they have vs'd DIG and TL.
1605,5e385a34841d20c9f26171de,"Not really, he had a lot of bad games where he was getting caught where Zven was known as someone with 'ok' laning but amazing positioning in EU it went to 'ok' laning and pretty meh positioning in TSM."

1607,5e385a34841d20c9f26171e6,Uh how do you know all these intimate details about bjerg that you couldn’t possibly know ?
1608,5e385a34841d20c9f26171ea,Wtf
1609,5e385a35841d20c9f26171ee,Bjergsen is the ultimate gaslighter. He contributes so much to a negative team atmosphere and toxic work environment but everyone that worked with him praises superficial aspects of his work ethic. They judge everyone else by the metrics that Bjergsen is exemplary in and place 0 value on what other people bring to the table. His fragile ego and victim mentality are hard to overcome given his childhood experiences and it's baffling to see TSM all-in on this guy even harder when they've already tried everything except switch out the mid laner since 2014.
1610,5e385a35841d20c9f26171f2,Huh? Reddit continues to surprise me
1611,5e385a35841d20c9f26171f6,"Weird logic, that was literally more than 2 years ago. Just because he didn't have that problem back then that doesn't mean he wouldn't be able to develop that problem after, which he evidently did."
1612,5e385a35841d20c9f26171fa,"Zven also played fine on TSM he just had blunders everyone else on the team had, they just didn't mesh well and that's it."
1613,5e385a35841d20c9f26171fe,not bad team because if his team sucks then he will look bad also. Average team is probably best
1614,5e385a35841d20c9f2617202,"So we can't ever judge players on good teams, cool."
1615,5e385a35841d20c9f2617206,It's pretty rare to see rationality here on reddit
1616,5e385a35841d20c9f261720a,"Yes but you‘re implying zven wasn‘t to blame for TSMs failure when he cost them numerous big games himself, like the spring final.

You can‘t leave out the full context if you‘re gonna flame an entire fanbase/org."
1617,5e385a35841d20c9f261720e,"It's a bit different to do so well in LCK compared to LCS. 

I dislike Zven's personality with a passion, but good on him, hopefully it continues this way. The reason why there were so many posts about it was A - he was taunting Jensen in every champ select and B - that mistake lost them the game. Was the same when Jensen inted on Ekko."
1618,5e385a35841d20c9f2617212,"maybe thats why Kobbe joined, he was thinking he has to sandbag in TSM for a bit then go ultra instinct after"
1619,5e385a35841d20c9f2617216,"Not to mention MVP svenskeren, amazing going to semi's with Origen and Wildturtle on that monster immortals lineup (though given they had doublelift then it's not as big). Tbf there are noticeable exceptions like Hauntzer who has been significantly worse since leaving TSM but I do wonder if there is something wrong with the TSM culture that leads to so many great players performing poorly for them only to bounce back once they leave. Like maybe it's the pressure of the brand or its Regi or its the coaching staff, but something definitely seems to be wrong there."
1620,5e385a35841d20c9f261721a,"DL didn’t get kicked for his short comings, despite not properly preparing for back to back worlds. Zven and Mithy were a packed deal. 

Zven also left TSM and didn’t get kicked. He wanted to leave with Mithy last year."
1621,5e385a35841d20c9f261721e,I am the guy that hopes that happens ohhh yeaajhhhh
1622,5e385a35841d20c9f2617222,"They also passed on Johnsun, who has looked fantastic so far."
1623,5e385a35841d20c9f2617226,TSM new CLG curse?
1624,5e385a35841d20c9f261722a,But Dl had 2 titles on tsm and 3 if he played spring. Sorry but this isnt like tsm didnt have auccess with DL LMAO.  Its 2 weeks in for zven i cant wait for u guys to change ur minds when they have a bad week
1625,5e385a35841d20c9f261722e,Imagine the storyline when tsm is at msi this year
1626,5e385a36841d20c9f2617232,"It is after one great season. Splyce usually is bad at wave management and their splits go like that as well. It is basically a wave. Spring was bad, Summer was good, and 2018 was bad in general.

I mean the best thing Splyce managed to do in 2018 was that Solokill from Kobbe on DL to win Rift Rivals for EU (because G2 fumbled against Echofox, so NA would have been at match point). Splyce went 0:3 against NA before winning a really important game in relay. Kobbe is consistent, but not necessarily great all the time."
1627,5e385a36841d20c9f2617236,"Norskeren basically got the same treatment most NA players get. Looked good domestically, had a lot of strengths that a good team can play around, but wasn't one of the 10 best players in the world at his position and it showed at Worlds, therefore he must be garbage."
1628,5e385a36841d20c9f261723a,There really are Norskeren haters? That's why he got replaced by his evil twin Tore?
1629,5e385a36841d20c9f261723e,TSM also had Johnson in academy.
1630,5e385a36841d20c9f2617242,Honestly Zven always was super professional. He grinds super hard and I watched them stream in korea (Zven+Vulcan) and regardless if things went well or not they enjoyed it and I think that is actually what makes him play good.
1631,5e385a36841d20c9f2617246,"He said this in an Invenglobal interview that came out just yesterday, unfortunately inven got banned on this sub for whatever reason so the interview wasnt posted here."
1632,5e385a36841d20c9f261724a,"I agree, groupthink is an insane phenomenon. The most egregious example I've seen recently is the hate for Xmithie. The man has *six fucking LCS titles* and now that Immortals are doing poorly a large percentage of this sub thinks that he always sucked and was carried by his team.

How in the absolute fuck can someone come to that conclusion rationally? Even if you ignore the analysts and players/teammates that have praised him over the years,  you can't win LCS SIX TIMES while being a shit player. It's just not statistically possible."
1633,5e385a36841d20c9f261724e,It was mainly TSM fans needing someone to scapegoat but now that Zven isn't on TSM anymore those people can't really say anything. I don't get your point.

Edit: Forgot Hauntzer somehow. Had good individual performance, but his best play and career high was on TSM"
1635,5e385a36841d20c9f2617256,"Such as?

Sven - but now he's playing like shit on EG, and has always been feast/famine, but was good with us as well.

Grig? - Dig is playing really well and we were a shitshow last year but he had wrist problems

Hauntzer played well here and then went to do a team that blows and has been fine personally but poor team.

Who have we lost that under performed here and then went on to be better?  Everyone while here was equally as good"
1636,5e385a36841d20c9f261725a,"This is kinda bullshit.

Sven is having a terrible season, Hauntzer has been average since leaving with a couple of good games, Grig has also been average, Yellowstar never really recovered.

Besides Zven, what former TSM player had a great season after leaving?"
1637,5e385a36841d20c9f261725e,Kobbe is playing super well though
1638,5e385a36841d20c9f2617262,Parth
1639,5e385a36841d20c9f2617266,"Not in 2017 lmao. DL/Bio got dumpstered by international botlanes, DL himself even said they were awful and rarely even won lane in scrims. Bjergsen/Hauntzer talked about how they weren't happy with their botlane at the end of 2017 and how they literally didn't even know botlane matchups which made drafting a nightmare.

Meanwhile Zven/Mithy were smashing left and right and matched up to top botlanes like Samsung & RNG

In 2018-2019 Doublelift was leagues ahead of Zven, but in 2017 when Zven replaced Doublelift that was a MASSIVE upgrade. I always think it's so stupid when people say kicking Doublelift was a ""mistake"", it's similar to Misfits building their superteam in 2019 - It definitely wasn't a mistake to sign Soaz, Maxlore, Febiven, Hans and Gorilla. That roster was fucking STACKED on paper. Just because it didn't work out you can't just use hindsight and be like ""yeah that was a mistake"" when it was a perfectly reasonable move at the time."
1640,5e385a36841d20c9f261726a,Maybe domestically but Zven has definitely shone brighter internationally. Even back when G2 boomed at worlds he still looked good.
1641,5e385a36841d20c9f261726e,"It's been 6+ years since the Baylife days and the cockiness and all that, but I guess that image still sticks with people, which is pretty sad. But oh well."
1642,5e385a36841d20c9f2617272,"but it clearly isn't a case of a player just not being good enough. he's obviously good enough, and just didn't work on TSM, as the guy above says. unfortunately that seems to happen a lot. TSM has had all the good players it should need to do well, but doesn't, for unknown reasons."
1643,5e385a37841d20c9f2617276,People forgetting Zven solo losing spring finals with a braindead move lol.
1644,5e385a37841d20c9f261727a,How can you know it’s Parth
1645,5e385a37841d20c9f261727e,">  Hence why Froggen wasn't doing well on several NA teams

Froggen was top 3 in every relevant statistical category while also having the lowest Gold share out of the top 5 mid laners. Froggen was looking good; he was just losing a lot."
1646,5e385a37841d20c9f2617282,"He wasn't the main carry in G2, perkz was. Zven would play for teamfights and he was great at it."
1647,5e385a37841d20c9f2617286,Zven wasn't the main carry in any of the EU teams
1648,5e385a37841d20c9f261728a,"Hard disagree on C9's solo lanes, Licorice is outclassing every top laner right now, and Nisqy has always been considered a top 3 mid in LCS."
1649,5e385a37841d20c9f261728e,Standing on top of Skarner with E flash and walking closer to Skarner is him trying to carry too hard?

1651,5e385a37841d20c9f2617296,"TSM is an organization which had the same problems for years. Yet they can’t seem to fix or adjust them. 

How did they manage to drop so down from a crown they held so far above the rest? 

The answer is very simple. 🤡🤡🤡"
1652,5e385a37841d20c9f261729a,TSM has regi who despite being a good businessman is clearly unwilling to accept the fact that he is washed up and keeps trying to be an integral part of the LoL team staff and keeps fucking it up. Every TSM video I’ve seen this guy is there either breathing down the players necks or lecturing about something he doesn’t know about. It’s like those collegiate teams who are coached by a silver rank when all the players are diamond.
1653,5e385a37841d20c9f261729e,"At this point, I think Bjergsen’s part of the problem. After all, he’s been on the team for so long now that it seems like he’s fine with the issues present."
1654,5e385a37841d20c9f26172a2,"Good might be a bit of a stretch, Contractz looked a lot closer to mediocre, but even that is better than what he looked like outside of C9"

1656,5e385a37841d20c9f26172aa,Making out of groups has no trophy
1657,5e385a37841d20c9f26172ae,Do you get a trophy for getting out of groups? I would rather win LCS than get out of groups.
1658,5e385a37841d20c9f26172b2,Getting out of groups isnt winning anything. 90% pros would rather win their domestic league than get out of groups
1659,5e385a37841d20c9f26172b6,"DL's recent worlds track record is something to behold:

Worlds 2019: 3-3 out in groups

Worlds 2018: 3-3 out in groups

Worlds 2017: 3-3 out in groups

Worlds 2016: 3-3 out in groups

Is it bad luck?  Maybe, other teams get out of groups with 3-3.  We'll see next year, but if it happens again I can't imagine he can keep going.  It's just a curse at this point."
1660,5e385a37841d20c9f26172ba,"Better coaching staff. More flexible players in positions other than AD.

And tbf to TSM, they were the best performers for NA at Worlds 2016, but C9 (the worst performer by a good margin) made it out of groups."
1661,5e385a38841d20c9f26172be,Tsm with niels would be unstoppable xD he would never throw a game by arcane shifting into 5 people!
1662,5e385a38841d20c9f26172c2,? Regi can still boot him off the roster. It's not like a 50/50 ownership lol
1663,5e385a38841d20c9f26172c6,"Or just because Bjer is a great guy but with terrible outdated view on how to play the game and bring ""let's stall to late game"" Shotcall. 

Ex-teammates have nothing to say about his personality or work ethic, that's for sure. 

Now, after watching TSM for the last 3 years, there is something really wrong with the way they approach the game.

Like they declared, Regi and Bjer are the one deciding the roster and the coaching staff this year."
1664,5e385a38841d20c9f26172ca,"How can people not get that, the only real trashing a player got after a teammate left was DL from Link in his donezo manifesto. 

He had no intentions of playing professionally anymore so he let him have it wholesale."
1665,5e385a38841d20c9f26172ce,So they go out of their way to praise him?
1666,5e385a38841d20c9f26172d2,"TSM’s problems came from other teams getting better. They took TL to five games but because they lost, it won’t be remembered. If TL weren’t as good, there wouldn’t be this kind of flame against them."
1667,5e385a38841d20c9f26172d6,"I have another one.  


Bjerg has amazing work ethic.  


Which does not relate, in any way, to final results.  


See Goldenglue. He's another where I have no doubts. Therefore, he's given chances after chances and is well-regarded within the scene.  


Bjergsen is just a slightly better, better-positioned Goldenglue."
1668,5e385a38841d20c9f26172da,I always think the problem here is Regi. He always meddle with the team when problems come up and doesnt trust the coach he hires. I haven't seen any pro talking shit about Bjerg's gameplay lol how can he be the problem when he's winning a lot excluding the past 2 years even past the DL era
1669,5e385a38841d20c9f26172de,"I feel like all TSM fans are asking for is serious effort. Zven was the embodiment of that. Sure, he choked and it didn't work out, but we never had to ask if he was actually trying, unlike MikeYeung or even Hauntzer at the end."
1670,5e385a38841d20c9f26172e2,"It's because til the end he always seemed to care and he embraced the fanbase of TSM. He made me, as a TSM fan, feel like he really liked being a part of us and that he appreciated people giving him mroe chances and standing behind him. I personally respect him a lot and hope that he'll continue to smash it, until we beat him in the finals/semis this split."
1671,5e385a38841d20c9f26172e6,I don't think this is accurate or based in logic!
1672,5e385a38841d20c9f26172ea,"Like it or not, when the split is only 18 games, 4 games is relevant."
1673,5e385a38841d20c9f26172ee,"4 of 18, yeah it is."
1674,5e385a38841d20c9f26172f2,imo being as useful as zven while not dying for 4 games in a row matters
1675,5e385a38841d20c9f26172f6,He literally did.
1676,5e385a38841d20c9f26172fa,When players regularly play well both before and after being on TSM but then look noticeably worse on TSM that's a trend that indicates some kind of problem unique to TSM.
1677,5e385a38841d20c9f26172fe,You said it yourself. He just lost one fuckin game in two years. How is that bad? I can remember 10 from a lot 'good' adc's
1678,5e385a39841d20c9f2617302,"Well I don't know but kobbe right now plays like shit and guess what: after joining TSM 
But still it's just 3 games and kobbe didn't melt well with the team."
1679,5e385a39841d20c9f2617306,Wait is Canada not NA anymore? NA isn’t literally just America
1680,5e385a39841d20c9f261730a,Bio has been top 4 NA since he entered the league imo
1681,5e385a39841d20c9f261730e,did you really just rate Zeyzal and Smoothie below Aphromoo? Zeyzal has weak laning and Smoothie is inconsistent but they are both great supports who have consistently outperformed Aphro and consistently been pretty much at Bio's level.
1682,5e385a39841d20c9f2617312,Smoothie is a good support.
1683,5e385a39841d20c9f2617316,"Vulcan's Québécois not Canadian according to his twitter bio, and as a Quebec native I agree with him xD 

But yeah NA support pool is questionable, at least this season Aphro's been looking decent."
1684,5e385a39841d20c9f261731a,Oh no the horror
1685,5e385a39841d20c9f261731e,And that's a coaching issue. There was nothing wrong with Akaadian. He was mismanaged.
1686,5e385a39841d20c9f2617322,"Oooo, people now riding Vulcan so hard he's overtaken CoreJJ according to some people? That's a hot take... I guess anything to not give Zven credit"
1687,5e385a39841d20c9f2617326,Biofrost the #2 support? wtf lmfao. How are you going to rate him above either CoreJJ or Vulcan?
1688,5e385a39841d20c9f261732a,yes i mean Mithy
1689,5e385a39841d20c9f261732e,"C9 haven't played dig yet, gonna be on Sunday though"
1690,5e385a39841d20c9f2617332,"Do you think that might, you know, POSSIBLY have something to do with the TSM coaching staff?"
1691,5e385a39841d20c9f2617336,"At the very least, he is the only constant in the team over the years. Even the coaching staff keeps rotating all the time. Ever since LCS became actually competitive, TSM floats between ok to good"
1692,5e385a39841d20c9f261733a,"What intimate details?

Bjergsen was bullied BAD. It's well-documented and comes straight from himself: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=676609642362402&id=485525748137460&sfnsn=mo

As for what people praise about him it only takes listening to Parth or Loco talk about him in one of the many long-form interviews/shows to get a sense of how superficially he's the PERFECT player. The perfect teammate. Everything a coach could ask for. Yet every other player TSM places around him always crumbles and can't perform.

This is not unrelated. The fandom or staff's belief that Bjergsen can do no wrong is not random trivia. It contributes to the workplace environment whether intentional or not.

Bjergsen is the consistent performer on TSM. Everyone else underperforms.

Even TSM fans now say something is wrong with TSM as an org instead of putting Bjergsen through more scrutiny.

Now instead of reconsidering their mid position, they offer Bjergsen unprecedented pro player career stability in partial team ownership. People think the Huni contract is overkill? Even Faker would never get Bjergsen's level of special treatment by his org: he had to share the stage with another mid remember?

TSM is gonna get worse before it gets better. This will exacerbate the problem, not solve it. Dardoch thought Loco gave Piglet special treatment on TL... Boy he's in for a ride with TSM now.

Bjergsen is inscrutable within TSM and that didn't happen by accident. If he was really hungry for the win/recognition as a pro player on the world stage he would've voluntarily switched teams or even tried going back to EU to prove himself. He knows he'd be dumb to give up what he has at TSM. It's not loyalty. The chances of getting another org wrapped around a player's finger to this extent are slim to none."
1693,5e385a39841d20c9f261733e,i mean he really didnt but ok
1694,5e385a39841d20c9f2617342,"Yep. I am a huge Zven supporter and defended a lot of his performance on the team. 

I would have been fine with him staying if he wanted to."
1695,5e385a3a841d20c9f2617346,Teddy disagrees. Jin Air with him was mid table and without him relegated. A great player can make a bad team into a decent one.
1696,5e385a3a841d20c9f261734a,Overall zven was hands down the best player tsm had last year tho.
1697,5e385a3a841d20c9f261734e,You lose some you win some.
1698,5e385a3a841d20c9f2617352,"I disagree with Hauntzer being worse. He was in a worse team, which doesn't mean the same thing."
1699,5e385a3a841d20c9f2617356,"Amazing going to Quarters with TSM doesn't count?

Wildturtle having multiple titles with TSM doesn't count?

I agree that there is something wrong but you need to grab the right straws. 

I would blame TSM's management even more (not to say they have been doing something wrong with whatever the fuck happened to this team's playstyle after that spring split) if Zven didn't just play bad individually as well from his first season with them, watch the playoffs vs CG and just watch how he positions, watch the regular?/playoffs? games in the next split vs C9 (especially when he's on Varus WITH A TAHM KENCH) and he still goes melee range under C9 turret to auto it and brings C9 back in the game which begins the reverse sweep iirc.

I am glad he is doing good now and doesn't feel the same pressure as before, but chalking it up to a simple ""TSM dark arts forced him to be bad as an INDIVIDUAL"" is something a lot of people are doing now but it's not that simple. 

Almost like players have phases of being good and bad, slumps exist; nobody stays at the top forever. I hope he keeps doing well, but it sucks that people keep re-writing history because of that."
1700,5e385a3a841d20c9f261735a,"Ironically Sven got better on C9 only to go to EG and get worse (small sample size obv.)

&#x200B;

Might be something more to do with C9 than TSM."
1701,5e385a3a841d20c9f261735e,"I don't think ''brand pressure'' explains it now. Before you could say that, but with Zven bouncing back too, he had more pressure (in theory) after G2 vacation imo."
1702,5e385a3a841d20c9f2617362,"This is incorrect. Zven and Mithy being a package deal is just an excuse for the kick, they talked about how DL taking time off had shaken their expectations of him and their trust on him, and you can see on TL, it's not impossible to find a support on par with him without having to swap the whole lane, it's just a big dumb decision that has been exposed as such.

Zven also talks how TSM didn't want to renew his contract and has given him a heads up. So that's getting kicked, bro. Also he didn't want to leave last year, you can check his video before spring finals, he said he had offers but he didn't want his time in NA to be a waste, he wanted to double down and show he can be at the top."
1703,5e385a3a841d20c9f2617366,"He didnt get kicked, but TSM just randomly picked up Kobbe in 1 days."
1704,5e385a3a841d20c9f261736a,"Splyce had a strong early game, bad mid game and good late game.

Kobbe was never afraid to go ham if there was an opportunity, but Splyce often stalled in the mid game if they couldn't snowball and 2019 was heavily focused around early game snowball so they were not punished for their slow mid game as often.

TSM seems to be absurdly risk averse, like they only want to play perfect, even if they understand that they need to be willing to take on risk, it just doesn't translate. But Kobbe looks like someone who is willing to go ham, same with Dardoch and Brokenblade.

But this goes beyond any single player or person, it seems to be the expectations around improvement on both an individuel and team level is making them resistent to change.

That is at least how it looks from the outside."
1705,5e385a3a841d20c9f261736e,"Norskeren, just like Kobbe, has glaring weaknesses - his midgame. Inexplicable facechecking, going on solo rambo missions etc. In a meta that focused heavily on midgame, he was expected to look shaky at best, especially since Splyce, collectively, had a really poor midgame. He is very young though, the issues he has can be fixed with more experience and strong leadership. His mechanics are already there, and he's likely to grow into another Hylissang, perhaps even surpass him."
1706,5e385a3a841d20c9f2617372,Tbh Norskeren struggled at times domestically and I think a lot of EU viewers were scared of his performance at worlds.
1707,5e385a3a841d20c9f2617376,"One would think Norskeren was the evil twin, by the amount of flak he's been getting."
1708,5e385a3a841d20c9f261737a,"He is one of the most dedicated western players ever, dude is completely committed to his job and will grind his ass off if he has to, literally the first thing he did in all the times TSM got knocked out of playoffs was go home and grind soloq like a possessed madman until he was rank 1 while most other players in his situation would take a break, its crazy."
1709,5e385a3a841d20c9f261737e,"Yeah I didn't have an opinion of him personally prior to joining C9. Didn't really follow him too closely, and had never really watched anything in depth for his interviews. He's faced a lot of criticism (unfairly) and a difficult position in replacing the face of an org; I respect his composure, especially when he seems to get a lot of the same questions asked with slight differences."
1710,5e385a3a841d20c9f2617382,"I'm pretty sure most TSM fans were actually more supportive of Zven than anyone else, have you ever been to the TSM subreddit? All I remember was the main subreddit shitting on Zven for anything and everything, then suddenly he moves to a different team and everyone loves him. That's my point. I'm just tired of TSM being the scapegoat for everything that goes wrong in the galaxy. It's ridiculous how we get blamed or jabbed at in threads that don't even have any relevance towards us."
1711,5e385a3a841d20c9f2617386,"Santorin almost won mvp last year, his high was not on Tsm"
1712,5e385a3b841d20c9f261738a,"Honestly it is more true for non-american players. Amazing and Zven did well, Santorin actually wasn't on a team when he left. And I honestly think Yellowstar went there to retire, I honestly think he only came back to FNC because they begged him, they had an awful year in 2016. Since 2017 he is coaching the team Eika played on and this year he is playing again as a support, but I think more due to not having anybody else\^\^.

The bigger issues for TSM though are that the players they get are kinda random. The issue they have are either with Coaching or Bjergsen, because those are the only constants for the team. If you change top, jungle and botlane and your problems stay the same you have to look at the things that didn't change."
1713,5e385a3b841d20c9f261738e,thank you kind sir!
1714,5e385a3b841d20c9f2617392,"IDK how you can watch Hauntzer's performance in this split and say he's doing fine personally. In their game against c9, he missed every single Ornn ult except the first one in lane that didn't matter. Big time misses on important engages that 100% cost them the game. Then his indecisiveness  / inaction almost cost them their only win during a crucial fight at ocean drake. He isn't doing well."
1715,5e385a3b841d20c9f2617396,"Sven had 2 great seasons with C9 before this one after he was determined to be the problem on TSM.

Biofrost outperformed TSM on CLG last year.

DL hasn't lost a split since he got kicked from TSM.

Mithy made it to LEC finals the first split after leaving.

EDIT: And to elaborate, it's not as much about the players having great seasons, as it is that players on TSM almost never seem to have their best season on TSM. Santorin, Wildturtle, Amazing and the former mentioned all have better seasons in other teams. There's only Hauntzer and Bjergsen in recent memory and one of them has never left TSM."
1716,5e385a3b841d20c9f261739a,Amazing
1717,5e385a3b841d20c9f261739e,"Doublelift.

Also, Sven got an MVP award after leaving TSM (he's played poorly atm, but he still rebounced super hard after leaving TSM) and Amazing went to Semis at Worlds with a very solid personal performance (he was never a big carry anyway, more of a teamfighter/enabler).

Not that I necessarily agree with the ""TSM is the problem"" narrative, just thought I'd chime in with a few examples."
1718,5e385a3b841d20c9f26173a2,Zven was playing well on TSM too. Everyone just focused hard on a few bad moments rather than the fact that he was consistently strong for 2 years.
1719,5e385a3b841d20c9f26173a6,"Stop that, he could only suck on TSM"
1720,5e385a3b841d20c9f26173aa,"But he will be the scapegoat for TSM mid and jungle problems, like Zven"
1721,5e385a3b841d20c9f26173ae,True
1722,5e385a3b841d20c9f26173b2,"So? Zven and Mithy got dumpstered in 16 by fucking Likrit. And Biofrost was in particular absolutely horrendous.

And if picking Zven over DL by basing it on the later half of season 7, then the Misfits roster was a huge and obvious mistake as well. Maxlore, Febiven and Gorilla had all played awful in the later half of 18 and SOaz hadn't even been able to play worlds. You could at least be consistent in how you value these players."
1723,5e385a3b841d20c9f26173b6,Zven only went to MSI once (2017) and made finals. G2 'boomed' at MSI 2016 when they had Emperor + Hybrid.
1724,5e385a3b841d20c9f26173ba,"> Even back when G2 boomed at MSi he still looked good.

He wasn't part of that vacation squad, but your point stands."
1725,5e385a3b841d20c9f26173be,"DL has had plenty of good-looking and consistent performances on teams that boomed on him internationally. Put DL into a good EU team and he would have shone just as bright as Zven. There's nothing about DL that makes him lesser when comparing him to Zven, and I would argue DL has versatility in play-style that Zven never got.

Result based analysis is already bad, but it is especially bad when rating ADC's who are in almost every meta held hostage by their team-members performance to actually shine."
1726,5e385a3b841d20c9f26173c2,"People didnt dislike TSM during baylife era. Dyrus got some hate for fucking dig S2 but except that it wasn't out of the ordinary. The real TSM hate started when NA casters made biased worlds list over and over where Bjergsen was consistently put 10 tiers above the skill level he played. It's not TSMs or the players fault, it's the ""Analysts"" fault."
1727,5e385a3b841d20c9f26173c6,People still saying this -_- as if a five game series can be boiled down to getting caught in the river one time
1728,5e385a3b841d20c9f26173ca,"People forgetting that Zven was the best performing member of TSM for entirety of the spring until game 5 of finals. But sure, let's judge him based on one blunder he made (I'll also remind you, that TSM was 2:0 up, and the other 2 losses weren't in the slighest on Zven, but sure he ""solo lost"" them the finals)."
1729,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173ce,"We don’t because Zikz is the most to blame, followed by Akkadian massive throw 1v5 in enemy jungle after everyone backed twice in a free game.

It’s all the Zven haters can talk about but they ignore the whole story."
1730,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173d2,Because Parth has come out and admitted to the multiple mistakes he's made about roster/staff issues. He also said that they legit couldn't find a suitable coach so they forced Peter Zhang to be the head coach instead of a coaching consultant for TSM/TSMA rosters
1731,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173d6,"He was playing well, he was statistically excellent. And furthermore generally quite unimpressive because his team never managed to do anything."
1732,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173da,One of the main Carrie's at least. Because he did carry teamfights.
1733,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173de,"G2 was debatable, Origen hell yeah he was. At least during worlds."
1734,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173e2,"I agree with Licorice but Nisqy has **never** been considered a top 3 mid in LCS. 

He only played in EU LCS for a year and we had atleast Caps, Perkz and Nukeduck ahead of him, maybe even Jiizuke and Sencux.

His stats are mostly abysmal compared to the rest of the field. 2018 Spring: 7th in KDA, not in the top 10 for Kill participation, 9th in GD@10, not in the top 10 for XPD@10, 10th in CSD@10, 9th in DMG% of the team and so on. In Summer it got a little bit better but still at most average maybe even below average. 

Its my personal opinion and a lot of people might not agree but I think he's around the level of POE, maybe a bit better with the added benefit of playing for C9.

*edit: I somehow misread LCS for EU LCS. But the story remains somewhat the same. He is not better than Jensen, Crown or Froggen, Bjergsen is debatable since they sucked last season and are even worse for now.*"
1735,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173e6,"There were times last year where c9 fans were blaming the org for getting nisqy over froggen. That doesn't sound like ""always top 3"" to me"
1736,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173ea,"now you are being to nice on us... ""subpar midgame"" would be an upgrade at this point"
1737,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173ee,"5 coaches, still worse than one kinda-competent coach anywhere else."
1738,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173f2,"They need to stop being loyal to Parth and move him to Fortnight and get some real management and coach for the league side.

He’s had two years of horrible blunders."
1739,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173f6,"Having a midlaner who is just your second boss at this point and not actually much better than any other decent player in his position surely doesn't help.

I think no matter what they try their chemistry will always be shit. I couldn't work in a team that treats certain players as more valuable than me just because of their brand."
1740,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173fa,"You do know Regi became hands off and stepped back two years ago to focus on all of TSM?

He helps on player decisions and signing paychecks. The only time he was directly involved with the team was right before gauntlet after Parth and Zikz fucked everything and Spica was in.

The person you are looking for is Parth."
1741,5e385a3c841d20c9f26173fe,*slams agree button*
1742,5e385a3c841d20c9f2617402,I genuinely recall people saying hes one of the best new talents and that hes a top 4 jungler
1743,5e385a3c841d20c9f2617406,"Tell that to the many tsm fans that have been begging for a decent international performance...or even to just make it to worlds at this point. Maybe C9 has not won a trophy which sucks but at least they have maintained relevance every year finishing top 3 and with some standout worlds preformances (by NA standards), and that is something I'll take with pride."
1744,5e385a3c841d20c9f261740a,"Gets you a lot more visibility and fan recognition.

Also c9's roster usually costs a lot less than  the average top tier na team."
1745,5e385a3c841d20c9f261740e,"no trophy but a loss of dignity lol, they were first seed many times with easy groups and still got stuck"
1746,5e385a3c841d20c9f2617412,"DL's World records is due to his coaching staff. NA teams come in with a great strategy that works great Week 1, and then Week 2, other teams adapt while we don't, and we get shit on macro wise. 2016 and this past year though, he lost winnable games due to some stupid blunders (Viktor play vs Samsung and Dragon play vs DWG)"
1747,5e385a3d841d20c9f2617416,"Man CIS teams from LCL made it from the group stage, lul."
1748,5e385a3d841d20c9f261741a,"I thought CLG was the worst performer, they lost twice to a wildcard team. 

&#x200B;

True, they did perform the best relative to the group they got."
1749,5e385a3d841d20c9f261741e,hey guys this is funny because niels is actually zven and he did this!!! LOL!!
1750,5e385a3d841d20c9f2617422,"He’s not saying that because of the ownership, he’s saying it because regi loves bjerg"
1751,5e385a3d841d20c9f2617426,"Right here, its insane to say he's not good but if you look at the way to team plays(and fails) and the fact that he's the only constant and the voice of the team its obvious that's the way HE wants to play and it doesn't work......clearly. We were hopinh Dardoch would be the stronger counter voice but Bjerg is already part owner by the time we got Dardoch so I doubt anything will change."
1752,5e385a3d841d20c9f261742a,"They've constantly had the same playstyle though, which is why people blame the common denominator. If there's a culture and playstyle that remains no matter how many rosters you go through, and the denominator is the team captain, then obviously people will find it likely he is the problem. 

I think Bjerg is good, but honestly, it would be good if they took ONE spring split where they let everyone else on the team talk instead of Bjergsen. Let the others control the team for a split."
1753,5e385a3d841d20c9f261742e,"But honestly, the last good moment in TSM was 2017. So for 2 years now they are bad. And I think Mithy back in EU did actually talk about his time on TSM and that he wasn't allowed to play like he wanted, he basically had to play like the team did and wondered why they would get such players if they don't use their strengths.

So if people go back to EU they are more open to talk freely about that and he explicitly blamed TSM coaching, not really Bjerg (because a coach could still order him to play like he wants). I think it was an interview in spanish though."
1754,5e385a3d841d20c9f2617432,">Bjergsen is just a slightly better, better-positioned Goldenglue

Congratulations on what’s probably the worst take ever made on this subreddit"
1755,5e385a3d841d20c9f2617436,"I just think blaming Regi is as much of a blind hot take as blaming Bjerg, specially when they're so un-transparent with their internal dynamic.

And it doesn't matter what Bjerg did 2 years ago, players can decline or not adapt to the meta.

Personally I can see why he's blamed for his passiveness and how much that can hurt the team: look how DoingB won worlds, he's literally a reverse Bjergsen.

Of course he's a great teammate and all, just saying he *might* not be such a great midlander in the recent fast paced skirmish metas."
1756,5e385a3d841d20c9f261743a,"Yup, losing a match and then Zven playing 20 games in a row, winning most of them was great to see. Then there was Hauntzer who basically never played soloq"
1757,5e385a3d841d20c9f261743e,"he was only up in CS@15 min 30% of his games, and his Win Rate was 70%..."
1758,5e385a3d841d20c9f2617442,"If the split was 5 games does that mean 1 games is statistically relevant?


Or by statistically relevant do you mean “games already played have a strong influence on outcome of the split”?"
1759,5e385a3d841d20c9f2617446,What is your definition of “statistically relevant”?
1760,5e385a3d841d20c9f261744a,do you know what literally means ? ? ?
1761,5e385a3d841d20c9f261744e,"Nah I said ""Give it time before you judge players stats"" except you 'literally' can't read"
1762,5e385a3d841d20c9f2617452,kobbe is playing like shit? what? hes playing fine atm what do you mean
1763,5e385a3d841d20c9f2617456,Kobbe is arguably the best performing player on TSM atm... No way did he play as bad as you make it sound.
1764,5e385a3e841d20c9f261745a,"Lol and this is why hot takes from this sub are absolute garbage, you either didnt even watch him play or you have not the slightest idea what youre talking about, he is absolutely not playing like shit"
1765,5e385a3e841d20c9f261745e,I feel like you’d actually see he’s not playing like shit atm if you’d actually watched him play!
1766,5e385a3e841d20c9f2617462,It is NA
1767,5e385a3e841d20c9f2617466,nope NA stands for nothing (but) America :^)
1768,5e385a3e841d20c9f261746a,"Shhh, now is Canada's chance to cut ties and open up a new continent with maple syrup and poutine and free healthcare. We'll call this continent North Canada."
1769,5e385a3e841d20c9f261746e,He’s really not. Terrible positioning and vision control.

1776,5e385a3e841d20c9f261748a,I think that he is reffering to Vulcan as #2
1777,5e385a3e841d20c9f261748e,"No one has mentioned Biofrost yet, they’re referring to Zven playing better rn because he’s laning with the best support in the league, aka Vulcan."
1778,5e385a3e841d20c9f2617492,"Thanks for that. he had me confused as i missed the start of the lcs and only checked the standings thinking ""but they both have 0 losses?"""
1779,5e385a3e841d20c9f2617496,Zven getting caught out in high pressure situations is the coaching staffs fault? This is some high quality mental gymnastics
1780,5e385a3e841d20c9f261749a,I'm pretty sure Zven was still using the keyboard and mouse himself. And I doubt coaching staff told zven to eat every hook thrown at him or 1v5
1781,5e385a3f841d20c9f261749e,"i feel that is because teddy is insane player, not only good."
1782,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174a2,Even that jin air team had a better idea of how to play league than tsm.
1783,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174a6,The exception isn't the rule. That's the same reason why Faker looked pretty shit in s8 and in S9 regained some form. It's a team game there will be some player that are just so insane they can solo carry consistently but there are even more good and great players that can't.
1784,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174aa,"Not in TSM, apparently."
1785,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174ae,He has been pretty shit this split.  Bottom tier top for sure
1786,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174b2,During internationals he was talked about as the next big NA home grown talent. Haven't heard about him since TSM.
1787,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174b6,"Well Amazing did go to quarters on TSM, left TSM and got to semis.

WildTurtle is a bit of an oddball, because i thought he always had the right playstyle for TSM but he wasn't an amazing player, also Turtle is from NA, this thing seems to be more true for non-NA players. Amazing and Zven both had the best year after leaving TSM. For Santorin it is a bit different, since he wasn't actually on a real team after leaving TSM so he wasted that bonus basically.

And the reason why Zven was bad is obviously TSM. They never play to their superstars. If you get that super botlane from EU you have to play the style they want. You can't play your usual Bjergsen does something and maybe we win style. And honestly one of the reasons TSM is so bad is because they stagnate mostly while other teams make leap after leap forward."
1788,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174ba,"Tbf Amazing looked individually the same after leaving TSM (pretty much at least) however Wildturtle on Flyquest individually looked a decent chunk better than on either of his TSM stints (except for his first split).

People aren't rewriting Zvens career now after leaving TSM but if you have a career from best in the west to propably bottom 3 ADC in NA to best performing ADC in NA you have a pretty good picture of his career.

A team reliant role like ADC, jungle or support looking their worst in TSM speaks a lot more against TSM's entire culture (they had like 6 coaches since Loco left and neither stayed for more than a year) than it does about the individual level of these players."
1789,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174be,"That is true, and tbf we saw Sven being a god on TSM at times it just seemed like he slowly got worse there and slowly got better at C9, while Zven had an immediate drop between G2 and TSM and an immediate jump between TSM and C9, so it's different this time but it does still feel weird."
1790,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174c2,Didn't Zven say here ([https://youtu.be/f2GLefjGPKQ?t=6130](https://youtu.be/f2GLefjGPKQ?t=6130)) that he wanted to leave with Mithy and play in Europe for 2019 but TSM wouldn't let him go?
1791,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174c6,"[Zven literally talking about how he wanted to leave TSM in 2018](https://youtu.be/f2GLefjGPKQ?t=6091). But hey, I'm sure that his PR statements are true, and not this most recent podcast when he didn't need to hold back."
1792,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174ca,They knew he wanted to leave for a whole year lol
1793,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174ce,"And honestly Norskeren had 3 big issues, they were named Ignar, Hyllisang and MikyX. If EU wouldn't have had 3 outstanding supports he would look much better, but if you compare him to those he looks weak. I don't think he looked bad at worlds and Splyce overall looked very cohesive you can't really make out the player that held them back.

And right now Norskeren and Patrik look really great on Excel and actually carry games from Laning."
1794,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174d2,"Damn, I always enjoyed watching him and I genuinely thought he was quite underrated. He played at a high level even in mediocre teams. He also seems like a really cool dude. I don't know how he's doing now as I barely watch LEC games outside FNC, G2 and OG games, but I would have thought that Excel's strongest lane was botlane."
1795,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174d6,"Honestly I feel like for him this is a break. Playing SoloQ for himself removes him from all the stuff that happens in a pro environment. I feel the same about Caps. When you watch them stream they enjoy playing, they even enjoy losing, they just like to play the game."
1796,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174da,"I'm from germany, and over the past we did a lot of stuff with denmark and while I have gotten a lot of shit from some people just for being german, I only have met nice danes. Whenever they visit here or I visited denmark they were usually super friendly people and also really modest. And I think if you look at the danes in league they are like that."
1797,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174de,"Yep, this subreddit is killing all the fun of the LCS for me. This sub shits on our players while we defend them, then after the players leave this sub praises them and shits on us for supposedly blaming them all the time.  It's so fucking annoying."
1798,5e385a3f841d20c9f26174e2,"yes it was, he has an international title and LCS championship with TSM????"
1799,5e385a40841d20c9f26174e6,He helped NA get its only international trophy on TSM. That's somehow less of a high than *almost* getting LCS MVP?
1800,5e385a40841d20c9f26174ea,Golden Guardians are a meme. The only game they won was Hauntzer carrying his heavy ass deadweight team.  I think he's doing as best as can be expected given his circumstances
1801,5e385a40841d20c9f26174ee,"Ask any TSM fan, his Ornn is just not good.

Don't judge him on that. Even in his best years he turned on int mode when they had him play the Ram. (I mean, clearly don't give him a free pass, but a champ that he's never been able to play isn't proof that he's washed)"

More like 1 1/2, people always choose to ignore that he was hard inting in Spring 2018 which got so bad that he literally got benched for a while. And now hes playing terrible again. Might not just be TSM whats the problem here.

> Biofrost outperformed TSM on CLG last year.

According to who? Biofrost was Top 3 on TSM, Biofrost was Top 3 on CLG, Biofrost has been playing very well since his return. I dont really see that as outperforming but if youre trying to fit a narrative i guess it works.

> Mithy made it to LEC finals the first split after leaving.

That is the only one on your list where i agree, Mithy played alot better post TSM than he did on TSM, but tbf on OG he didnt have to teach his jungler how to play the game while playing support himself.


> Santorin, Wildturtle, Amazing and the former mentioned all have better seasons in other team

Lmao excuse me? How did Turtle NOT peak in TSM? You unironically think he has been better on FLY or IMT than he was in  2014 for TSM? You started watching league 2 years ago i guess?

Similiary, Santorin was REALLY good in Spring 2015 and actually helped TSM to an international tournament win. He fell off a cliff in Summer 2015 and stayed that way for quite a while, one can argue that hes better now than he was back then but even here i wouldnt say its obvious by any means.

And Amazing only played a single split for TSM before he got homesick and he did pretty fine in that split considering the circumstances, yea he arguably played better in 2015 but his Team was also better."
1804,5e385a40841d20c9f26174fa,"I think its pretty easy to argue that Santorin, Wildturtle and Amazing had their best seasons on Tsm. I dont think there was a significant skill disparity at the least"

1816,5e385a41841d20c9f261752a,"Honestly NA teams loved to play into that hype. Just look how some of them figured that TL might be a dark horse for worlds, at most they ended up as a limping donkey. People complained why Jensen isn't on any of the top20 lists and things like that.

Just before the C9 game someone from TL said that they don't view C9 as a threat.

I think one of the reasons why C9 is good is because they are really reflected, when they were asked about the other teams they didn't say they are far above anybody else they said that they might lose to DIG because they look really good. And of course some of it is trashtalk, but I honestly think many NA teams are really bad to realize what there position is. When I always hear that TL is far above anybody in NA I wonder why it never shows. They are usually only one game apart from the second team in the regular split, they also actually have a negative winrecord against C9 in summer (3:4) and they also had a really close final against TSM before."
1817,5e385a41841d20c9f261752e,"Honestly, Zven wouldn't even be the only one. DL and Cody have similar moments. Flash into Victor? Jump into Cass? And all of those were deciding games. 

And a game like this in a 5 game series, where nothing is happening and your team slowly gets outscaled, it is terrible to play that. Just think about it, if you ever had your promos and you picked an early game champ and won, and you only need to win that game to get to promotion and then your team suddenly decides to do nothing with your lead. That was the position Zven was in. If Zven didn't get caught there the game would likely go on. But Kaisa, Vladimir and Skarner? TSM had no tools to deal with that.

In such a situation when a game slowly slips away players like that tend to go for a play, even a bad one. Not to mention that 35 or so minutes into a game 5 of a series you are also exhausted."
1818,5e385a41841d20c9f2617532,">People forgetting that Zven was the best performing member of TSM for entirety of the spring until game 5 of finals.

1819,5e385a41841d20c9f2617536,If a player is putting up great stats on a shit team they should get the benefit of the doubt IMO. LoL is so team dependent that trying to single handedly win games is usually pointless (unless you are e.g. prime Faker or Dade).

He was voted 3rd all pro mid in spring, 2nd all pro mid in summer. It literally was the consensus among pros/coaches/analysts that he was top 3. You can disagree with it, but it was still a widely held opinion.

> He only played in EU LCS for a year and we had atleast Caps, Perkz and Nukeduck ahead of him, maybe even Jiizuke and Sencux.

EU has far better mid laners than NA, so him being middle of the pack in that region doesn't mean he can't be top 3 in LCS, a weaker region with less competition at his role."

1825,5e385a41841d20c9f261754e,"Jiizuke and Nisqy were very close, with Nisqy being better in spring playoffs and part of regular summer where he was carrying Splyce, mainly on Zoe. Jiizuke had a better regular spring and summer playoffs, and was also generally more of a pop-off player with high highs and low lows, compared to Nisqy’s general stability with pop-offs from time to time. 

Sencux wasn’t better though, except for like the 9-game streak that MSF had (but being better for 9 games out of an entire season is hardly enough, especially when he was horrendous later on)."

Humanoid even in EU was 2nd I believe, behind Csacsi, in isolated deaths.

Larger parity in the lanes, mid-lane couldn't 1v9 as easily as in 4, and NA had just far better competition. After top 3 everything fell off a cliff in 4.

That was your exact question. Doublelift definitely fits the bill and is an obvious answer.

I would also argue that he has been better since he left TSM than he was with them on average, though the difference is small and definitely arguable.

You probably wanted to ask for the names of players that played poorly on TSM and played better after they left, but that’s not the question you asked.

Kaisa, Vlad, Skarner and Braum outscale anyway, so TSM lost that game the same way the lost that game to IMT, Zvens death only made it less painful to watch.

Yes TSM had Akali but it isn't as if Brokenblade would win a 1vs4 with it, so that was the only champ they had that scales well. Reksai just blows up. That game basically went into a massive stalemate and that makes TSM lose.

And you've gotta be extremely naive to think, that a public interview on official Riot broadcast was nothing but a PR stunt, and Zven couldn't really be honest.

I mean if you look at Splyce squad they had those two relatively new players with Norskeren and Humanoid. I think for how they were viewed at that time they performed well. Humanoid also likely did win them a game. There wasn't that super heavy mistake. Yes some Norskeren plays looked really odd, but you have that from players like MikyX and Hyllisang as well, it is just that a support can easily do something that looks great when it works or stupid when it doesn't.

And yes Humanoid has a lot of solodeaths. I think though Jizuke was in front of him or maybe it was just overall deaths. But that is also his playstyle. You can see on Mad Lions now that Humanoid still can make or break games."

And you said that if you give DL an EU team he would shine, but if you put him on the two best EU rosters he would be a weak point."

2 of his 4 games so far were on morgana and pantheon, I wouldn't expect him to be doing much dmg relative to his teammates. Even his veigar game he basically built for utility (twin shadows + GLP) and didn't have time to scale and get lots of burst since the game was only 24 minutes.

Also him having a low DMG% could also be due to his team investing resources elsewhere, not because he is lacking in skill. Jensen was 9th among starting mid laners in DMG% last split, yet was still voted the best mid in the region. His low DMG% came from TL being an extremely bot side focused team, not due to poor play.

> For me, the fact that he is playing the most impactful role in the game not as a carry but in a supportive way is a testament to other players on the team being way better than he is and other midlaners being better than he is.

I don't see a way for TSM to win there. Skarner just runs at someone had he is dead. And yes they could probably have kept TL from taking it for a while, but then TL would have scaled further. And I remember watching that game I knew TL had won it when TSM didn't do anything with their big lead."

TSM only by the end of spring actually started playing fast LoL consistently, before it'd be one fast, one slow game, all because Bjerg couldn't snowball his leads into wins.

First of all I never said Nisqy is a bottom tier midlaner, I just dont think he is a top3 midlaner. Secondly Jensen has already proven himself to be capable of carrying a team, like he did on C9 for several years. Nisqy has neither done that in EU nore has he done it in NA. So the question still remains the same: Should we call a supportive roleplayer **top tier** in their respective roles? I'd argue we cant, because otherwise he would be carrying the burden of the team.

Now in 2020 hes still playing, but hes only a bottom 4 adc in his league anymore but he still manages to more or less keep up with all the new players. In 2019 he didnt make any international tournament just like the few years before and was mid tier at very best in his league but more bottom 3.

And my point about the DL, Rekkles and Perkz wasn't to prove that he's not better than them, but that FNC and G2 needed a specific style, champ pool and consistency from their bot laners, and DL doesn't match them when it comes to that, hence the weak point (he's better than them at other stuff, but I struggle to think of an EU team that would put that to use)."
1933,5e385a47841d20c9f26176fe,"> My stats for Nisqy were from last summer. Not from this season.

Okay, but the gist of my points still apply. DMG% is heavily influenced by champion pool, where the team invests resources, team macro, etc. It's too context dependent to use as a marker of skill. 

> Jensen has already proven himself to be capable of carrying a team, like he did on C9 for several years. Nisqy has neither done that in EU nore has he done it in NA. 

Nisqy has though, ""playoff Nisqy"" was already a meme in EU because he was a monster in playoffs. Specifically in 2018 spring playoffs he hard carried his team to top 3. He also got player of the series in their B05 vs CLG last split. 

> Should we call a supportive roleplayer toptier in their respective roles? I'd argue we cant, because otherwise he would be carrying the burden in the team.

Supportive players still carry burdens, just different ones than dmg dealers. Being the main engage for the team is a burden, absorbing pressure without dying is a burden, having good roam timings is a burden, being a shotcaller is a burden, knowing where to be on the map is a burden, etc. 

It's why someone like Mata, a support player, is considered the 2nd best player of all-time. Or if you want a mid example, Kuro is easily a top 10 mid all-time and better than loads of carry mid laners because he's so phenomenal at his supportive style."
1934,5e385a47841d20c9f2617702,"Well if you look at the year after it already looks different.

Comparing that to the versatility of DL or Rekkles (which they also showed in S7) and you're pidgeon-holing yourself to a very particular play-style. There were obvious down-sides to the roster move, which people did point out at the time."

He went to worlds in season 3 and played against a peak piglet who even said he was one of if not the toughest adc’s to play against. He went to quarters at worlds in season 4. He won an international title in 5 and still went to worlds (albeit tsm shat the bed that year in groups). Then he won another title on tsm in 7. 

So tell me what he did better in s6. Because I’ve watched every single one of his games even when on immortals."

1947,5e385a48841d20c9f2617736,"I mean he did play well on TSM, they did win those splits, but to be fair I think competition in NA was also lacking most of the time. So the issue with TSM is that they couldn't keep up with the improvement other teams made. 

And TSM and C9 are basically on the opposite side of things. Both teams had many different players over the last years, and while C9 consistently ""lost"" offseason and usually gave away good players they always made the players they got in return work. And TSM on the other hand made many big moves and they never worked. It is a more recent issue though that basically started with Zven and Mithy and that team also had MikeYeung.

TSM basically struggles to find an identity and since many player said it isn't Bjergsen, it likely has to do with the staff. Because I honestly think Bjergsen is good enough to play whatever you tell him to play."
1948,5e385a48841d20c9f261773a,"He played a massively strong weak-side with almost 50% first-blood participation, were great at maximising damage, mispositioned far less and had higher dpm than any of the previously mentioned seasons despite having shorter game-time to abuse late-game damage potential of adcs.

He did everything better on IMT and with fewer resources."
1949,5e385a48841d20c9f261773e,"Turtle was a beast at season 3 worlds. You can argue Santorins best split was 2015 spring. Amazing was very good on TSM 2014. The skill difference between then and 2015 Origin was negligible and doesnt fit the narrative of players playing better because they left TSM. Ill agree for players like Yellowstar, Zven, Mithy, but turtle, santorin, amazing? Some if not their best years were on TSM"
1950,5e385a48841d20c9f2617742,"Which again was also debatable at the time and expressed by multiple people in 18, as it was perfectly clear that Biofrost had shown far more issues than DL did, and is also why Zven was picked because Mithy demanded they were package deal rather than TSM had a wish to replace DL. And DL doesn't require resources, he gets them because his team-mates are always far more outclassed than he ever was.

It's the same reason why Rekkles also improved massively when he got a support that could match him in Hylisang."
1951,5e385a48841d20c9f2617746,"Just you saying he mispositioned less negates every thing else and shows you don’t know. He has never ever gotten over his flaw of mispositioning. Adrian played nothing but healing and shielding supports that allowed him not to die when he was fighting from a position he should have never been in. Still to this day he has positioning errors just like he did on imt and before then too. 

And of course he had higher dpm. All immortals ever did was fight around the map constantly. Anyone would have a higher dpm on that team compared to previous seasons. 

I’m a huge turtle fan but you’re blowing shit out of your ass trying to say he became better after leaving tsm."
1952,5e385a49841d20c9f261774a,"Zven was never going to have the support issue, with Mithy next to him. Zven, by himself, had more consistent performances that had a slight edge, but he also had years of experience with Mithy, while DL did not. 

&#x200B;

Even if you look at Worlds 2018, you see Zven having much better stats than DL, despite the fact that he played in a much harder group.   


And the resource point wasn't directly aimed at DL on TSM, since he wasn't the sole carry back then, but that Zven did not require too many resources to do well into Uzi and Ruler (and to also achieve the highest DPM and DMG% at the tournament)."
1953,5e385a49841d20c9f261774e,"I didn't say he got over his tendency to misposition. I said he did it less frequent. I am all for discussing this, but this ""gotcha take-down"" bullshit is dishonest."

1979,5e385a4f841d20c9f26177b8,"Because he's your typical CertainlyT trash. Everything is an advantage, every ability combos with one another perfectly and the kit covers as many weaknesses as possible. He doesn't design anything with balance in mind.

1980,5e385a4f841d20c9f26177bc,"At this point all of these threads are just an echo chamber, your complaints were heard months ago and they’re already taking apart his kit and working on visual clarity for everything. 

I wish more people knew that and didn’t just keep posting about him."
1981,5e385a4f841d20c9f26177c0,"> is almost just as happy to gun you down with his sniper rifle in melee range, or duel another adc using only his slow gun.

No offense but that's must be low elo things. He only won duel with crescendum or situational severum. Also Gravitum have indeed worse scaling (+35% bonus AD and scale better with AP - 70%). Infernum have 80% bonus AD and calibrum 60% bonus AD."
1982,5e385a4f841d20c9f26177c4,"Aphelios kinda sucks at 1v1ing other adcs in late game. He can burst them with the right setup and an ambush but his dps is just not that high. His gravitum, infernum, and calibrum guns are just not as good as other adcs' steroids in terms of dps. In this way, I would say he is punished for not having the right gun. 
If he lacks infernum, outside of buying runaan's his damage in teamfights is limited to single target, which makes it hard to carry a fight. 
Not having Severum or Crescendum + Gravitum could cause you to die to the enemy assassin without a chance to resist. 

Getting a switch to Gravitum in a late game fight might as well be the same as getting a dead hand because you're not going to be able to get rid of 50 ammo anytime soon, and the weapon is subpar when the enemy is not running or melee and immobile. Getting Crescendum is pretty nice most of the time, except it actually negatively affects your dps when chasing. 

I would say Severum is probably the gun that is the best for most situations (has overheal, sustain, dps while kiting, and synergizes well with every gun except maybe Infernum). 

Gravitum is extremely good offhand with low ammo in almost every situation, but terrible in main hand unless you don't have to worry about your damage. The weapon is just slow. It's like Jinx rocket without everything that makes it good, replaced with a slow, which isn't bad, just makes it bad for dps. Which is why you apply the slow with any weapon other than Gravitum. I don't know if riot wants every gun to be equally balanced but if so then I think gravitum needs a buff to make it usable in main hand. Lower the slow if needed, just give it a better auto. It's probably intended to make it bad for damage, and make you plan your gun switching so you start a fight with low gravitum so you won't switch to it.

Crescendum is honestly too good. It works well with every gun, when the turret ability is not as good (Severum/Infernum), the gun ability works well with Crescendum (duskwave on multiple targets for instant chakrams, severum's onslaught produces chakrams over its duration while providing movespeed, helping with kiting, the chakrams main strength). 

Calibrum is extremely good with Crescendum, useful with gravitum, and mediocre with the other 2. Rather than poke I would say this gun is for finishing opponents and it does well with that. 

Infernum  has good synergies with every gun, but its ability is low range and slow. In contrast, its ult is extremely good for poking the backline. In practice, I have found little to no opportunity to 5 man infernum ult as doing so is a little hard when enemies do not generally group together in a tight clump. 

So yeah, he's definitely overtuned with some guns, but don't make the mistake of saying his guns have no downsides. Jinx's guns have downsides, but their upsides are also much better. Not only can she switch between them at will, but they are suited for different tasks as well, allowing her to excel at both. Aphelios can only excel in the right situation with planning. Anything otherwise is either luck or numbers that are too high."
1983,5e385a4f841d20c9f26177c8,"I kinda wish the guns had downsides plus more distinct upsides so that what weapons you had equipped actually mattered more than it does now. Somethign along the lines of:

- Calibrum: More range / Less attack speed scaling
- Severum: Healing / Less range
- Gravitum: Slow on-hit / Crits deal reduced damage but increase the slow
- Infernum: AoE cone / Cannot pass through units (will detonate in AoE upon hitting the first enemy target)
- Crescendum: Keep as is

If you'd buff some of the upside effects with a tiny amount, you'd actually create clearer moments a weapon shines and doesn't shine. Also I'm not a designer so this might actually be really bad but worth the thought anyway."

Balance around its slow utility to make up for it if needed, but the FLOOR on weapon damage should not be, oh ok he is a normal ADC.

Why would it not be? Draven doesn’t do negative damage for not having a spinning axe? 

The downsides are he doesn’t get his other guns active effects. Some of his numbers are insane (20 chakram is a pretty noticeable one) but most of the problem with the champs is his lack of visual clarity not the diversity of his guns"

1990,5e385a50841d20c9f26177e4,"The only change the champion needs is a complete rework to his weapons.

&#x200B;

They introduced him as a hard to master champion that was close to yasuo/riven/azir levels, in reality, his kit takes no decision making as every single ability/gun is good in every kind of situation and you dont really have to use your brain to adapt them and think of ""now i use this so in this situation i can have that one instead of this gun"".

&#x200B;

His weapons are all good for every single situation, there's no downside into having severum instead of calibrum or having gravitum instead of calibrum, same damage, slight less range but still same damage and utility.

&#x200B;

His weapons should be something the player has to use wisely to compensate and adapt to each situation, not to be good at anything they do at every single stage of the game."
1991,5e385a50841d20c9f26177e8,"ah yes, the good old ""i dont know how to play against X champion so better nerf this shit""

Aphelios is a good adc, but not overpowered like most people say. I agree it lacks visual clarity so people can outplay him, but he is sitting right now at 48% winrate and as higher the elo the lower the winrate. He is an immobile adc that needs very specific weapon combos against specific champions, he is so niche its just better to pick MF or senna.

He literally cant win any 1v1 with any weapon other than severum and still will probably lose against champs with AS steroids like jinx, trist or xayah.

gravitum is trash for dps so making it even worse wont change anything because you dont use for the damage but for the Q/ult"

1996,5e385a50841d20c9f26177fc,"This is not only a problem with Aphelios. Lately, all reworks/new champs since Akali or maybe even a bit before that, have one distinct characteristic: no weaknesses. They have kits that work for all situations, all teamcomps, and sometimes even most roles. Why? Because the designers are bad at the game and make champions where they can't lose in any situation. No matter the situation, they have such overloaded kits that they have the exact ability needed for that situation at the right time - and often times with low or no mana costs and low CDs. This is what made me go from almost playing competitively in Chile and signing a Riot contract in 2015 while hitting #1 with my team in the ladder to having LoL as my 3rd main game and playing once/twice every couple of days in 2020. Still get one or two accs to gm or chall every season but i leave them to die after that, the game is just a joke..."
1997,5e385a50841d20c9f2617800,I still think the champion would be so much better design if the player could (fairly) freely change between the guns AND they each would have their downsides. This would also allow the opposing team to better predict what he is likely to do.
1998,5e385a50841d20c9f2617804,aphelios bad
1999,5e385a50841d20c9f2617808,Why do they have to have a downside? He’s like Cait in that he’s an immobile marksman that gets punished severely by assassins and bad positioning.
2000,5e385a50841d20c9f261780c,"What champion has actual ""downsides"" like you mean? Aphelios doesn't get all his effects at the same time, he cycles through them. The ""downside"" to Gravitum? He doesn't get Calibrum range, Infernum AoE, Severum healing, or Crescendum's...Crescendum.

In fact, since you have a Kat flair, let's turn it around. What are her downsides? Personally, I think she should get .5 AP scaling and lose to all other AP champs because she's so mobile.

>If he does actually rotate through his guns properly he destroys you

Wow people that know how to play the champion beat you what a fucking travesty stop the presses"
2001,5e385a50841d20c9f2617810,Idk about you but early on the red gun or calibrum don't really do that much damage. But you guys can keep shaping the narrative I guess
2002,5e385a51841d20c9f2617814,Gladly he is banned in like 99% of my rankeds ^^
2003,5e385a51841d20c9f2617818,"you are right, other champ like that is kaisa, she got all this sweet pasive, and she pays in what? shes normal adc + boosted pasive and skills"
2004,5e385a51841d20c9f261781c,"From an assassins player viewpoint, he's a marksman with 0 dashes. Low Armor/MR/Health. His only ""escape"" is the movespeed from Severum and Gravitums Slow/Root, and depending on how quick you are or how slow the ADC is, you can easily kill him before he right clicks you or before he can root you. 

Speaking of Severum though, that weapon in particular appears to be a bit strong. Watching your Cait lose a 1v1 where she's a BF and dagger over him because of Severum Q is kinda depressing. Maybe the weapon itself needs to heal less, or maybe it shouldn't attack with Severum as much as it does.

Whenever I play the champ I feel like it's necessary to try to hold on to Severum, Gravitum and Infernum for as long as I can for fighting. I try not to use them for farming waves if I can. Now that may just be me not playing the champ enough or maybe it's the mindset that everyone has whenever they play the champ. 

So I feel like there's some form of weapon management, maybe it's not as extreme as people thought it was or hoped for but it's there. Maybe I'm overthinking it, maybe I can just walk around, take any fight with any weapon and win the game but when I look at it, the 3 weapons I mentioned cover everything an ADC is supposed to do, or cover everything you want in an ADC. A form of escape or good dueling/healing with Severum/Gravitum, you get a slow/root with Gravitum, and with Infernum you get a good amount of damage so logically you would want to keep those weapons at a usable amount for fighting and/or set them on a priority list and cycle through to get a refill. In lane, I won't use Severum until after I've used Calibrum, then when Gravitum comes in, I'll switch to Severum because I think Gravitum is more important to keep in general, but I guess it's very dependent on whats going on in lane as well. 

Anyway, I think Severum and like you mentioned, Crescendum should be looked at by Riot. 

To address the main point of your post, I think he gets punished quite a bit whenever he doesn't have his escape tools and that's not just by assassins. He can't take 1v1's against other ADC's or whoever if he doesn't have Severum and/or Crescendum unless he's considerably ahead of whoever he's trying to fight, and he's not guaranteed to have those 100 percent of the time, he can only have one of those all the time if he decides to just keep it from the 1st time he gets it and never uses it. 

This is his winrate/pickrate/banrate - total matches in every elo on patch 10.2 according to u.gg:

* Iron - **50.61**/**6.7**/**34.2** \- **8.5k** matches
* Bronze - **49.87**/**6.7/38.1** \- **32k** matches

2008,5e385a51841d20c9f261782c,"The issue with these suggestions is that his ROLE is dps. 

This is why ADCs did not have this level of utility in the early days of League. The best utility in the past was Ashe or Sivir. Everyone else had lots that focused purely on damage.


I’ll say it once and I’ll say it again, trying to push the limits on these champions IS fun and interesting. BUT, it is terrible for Leagues long term health. The game simply does not work with champions that can excel at so many things. 


Good champions have clear strengths and glaring weaknesses that provide clarity for the player and opponent. 

Darius for example is straight forward. Get 5 stacks. That’s his goal. Land the blade of the Q. Short range, has to run at you. Long cool down short range pull. GLARING weakness, clear avenues to win though. 

Compare kog maw and aphelios. Kog maw basically is a monster with his W up, and weak without it. Aphelios doesn’t have that. Sure gravitum is bad for dueling, but he’s just as threatening. The threat of CC is sometimes more threatening than damage. 

More importantly is that champions usually have a key ability in the past that once it’s used, that’s your window to outplay. Lucian dashes? That’s your window. Vayne condemned? That’s your window. Aphelios just doesn’t care about that. He poops a turret down and stands near it if he has to or walks away until he can put another one down. If he uses the CC he can follow up or disengage. 

There is just no real clarity with Aphelios and most new champions. They just give the new champions an answer for every scenario and it’s not healthy"
2009,5e385a51841d20c9f2617830,">Why does Aphelios not get properly punished for wrong weapon usage

What?  Who is the designer to say what is the right ability to use at the right time?  When has a negative feedback loop EVER been good game design?  How would you even design this kind of ""punishment"" when it's completely dependent on champion matchup and items and gamestate?  This will never be the right way to approach this.

Also balance for 99% of the playerbase is just a *feeling.*  When you change elder buff to an execute, even if it does less overall damage, it FEELS stronger.  Aphelios is objectively, quantitatively balanced at nearly exactly 50%.  You just FEEL like he's imbalanced, which is fine and your feelings are valid, but this means the solution is audio/visual or clarity, not damage."
2010,5e385a51841d20c9f2617834,Even Kalista is punished for having her jump passive...
2011,5e385a51841d20c9f2617838,"OFC all guns are an upside, these are his skills, riot does not want to make skills with downsides in favor of diversity because they are afraid poor silonze snowflakes will find them unfun."
2012,5e385a51841d20c9f261783c,"He's one of those common design pitfalls where he's super hard to create, leading the designer to think he'll be super complicated due to all of the different moving parts they had to build, but on the player's end it's super simple to execute all of those moving parts in one keystroke.

If anyone has played D&D, a DM I played with made up this original enemy of his which only had 25 HP, but every time you hurt it, it would heal itself with it's reaction ability to 5 less HP than it had before. So if it had 25 HP and you hit it down to 17 HP, it'd instantly heal back up to 20 HP. You couldn't counter it in anyway, and it always worked. The DM was so proud of this healing mechanic that he created, but in the end you'd get the same experience out of just making an enemy with like 75 HP. 

Even if you slave over a mechanic for weeks, if it has zero interactivity or incites zero choice making from the target of the ability, then you're probably needlessly overcomplicating something that could be done in a simpler way."
2013,5e385a51841d20c9f2617840,QT made a great point in him. You see the champ spotlight when it shows the baron fight. It literally is just “hey watch this dude kill everyone 3 different ways”

Skill ceiling is debateable where that lands [Although marksmen can have high ceilings]

Also did anyone really expect Aphelios to be anything *except* an aberration when it was announced he was made by CertainlyT? On top of his general track record; his prior ADC projects have been Kalista and the Graves rework [And the very small minor Caitlyn ""rework"" that was so tiny it hardly counts, and that was busted for a good while too]. Look how well those both turned out. Kalista basically had to be dumpstered and Graves was a complete failure at what it was actually supposed to do and ended up a jungler.

The only good thing about Aphelios is it's confirmed to be CertainlyT's last champ design project now he's been moved to TFT. Unfortunetly it's his final and perhaps biggest FU to the balance team. How on earth are the balance team supposed to balance a champion with 5 styles of autoattack; 20 different Q combinations [5 Q's each with 4 potential secondary effects] which can reset into each other; and 5 potential R's? Such a task is nigh impossible.

I actually feel sorry for the poor guys who have to try and fix this mess, and honestly the best way to deal with it might be to legitimately give him the Twitch/Evelynn treatment of 'dumpster intentionally until rework' because as it stands; his design is going to be nigh-on impossible to actually balance [And that's ignoreing internal balance between his weapons so they all are useful and feel OK to use...]"
2016,5e385a51841d20c9f261784c,Exactly. There's no skill floor because none of the choices are implicitly bad (or have any real drawback) in any situation. Just less good. And complexity with no real  skill expression means it's actually just not intuitive to use.
2017,5e385a51841d20c9f2617850,The downside is that you’ll sometime enter a teamfight with crescendum and gravitum

2029,5e385a52841d20c9f2617880,"Pretty much this. Are his numbers too high? Maybe. Probably. But his guns don't need artificial weaknesses to complicate his kit even more. He just needs to be slightly worse than any other ADC in the general case, so he's forced to be creative and use his guns to their fullest to get the edge in the situation. That, and he needs more clarity so that they *opponent* can play around him, but they're actively working on that already."
2030,5e385a52841d20c9f2617884,"Didn't this all happen because one person (Riv or Kobe) said Dardoch wasn't sure what Aphelios did when he got ulted by Aphelios? Even though he was really low health and he had the purple Gravitum effects around him? I'd rather believe that Dardoch was being on the safe side of the damage than him being confused about what was happening.

Also, I'm sure that across LEC and LCS Aphelios has an average winrate. Still think Senna ADC is much more of an abomination, but the Reddit circlejerk shall go on."

2038,5e385a53841d20c9f26178a4,"His kit is too overloaded as is. Doesn't mean he is strong aswell but it doesn't feel fair too play against. Let's compare the 2 latest released champions which are sett and aphelios. Sett top currently is pretty busted and sits with 53.6% wr in plat+ with a 7.7% playrate. Now aphelios on the other hand has a 48.3% wr with a 5.7% playrate in plat+. Now tell me, what champion do you rather play against in lane? I mean sett is busted atm so he should be pretty annoying to play against.

In my experience people would rather play against sett then aphelios just because of the anti fun kit aphelios has. He is fun if you play him but i don't think the designer and riot really thought out how it would be to play against him. To even back up my opinion: CertainlyT is the designer of this champion. He also designed yasuo and Zoe and guess what? They have the same kind of anti fun kit aphelios has. No one wants to play against it not because it is busted but just because his kit is not fun to play against. Ofcourse people will scream that his kit is busted just as they do with champions like yasuo and zoe. I think the complaints about aphelios are justified but people use the wrong reasoning for it. He is not OP as people say he is he is just ass to play against."

Yeah. You provided evidence that argues against your conclusion here."
2042,5e385a53841d20c9f26178b4,"It does seem so if you look at his kit as a whole but realistically, you only have access to two guns at a time. Not having the right gun at the right time or the right ammo to discard in time will severely affect aphelios.

 There's also the fact that aphelios doesn't have many steroid ability or any at all, in fact. He doesn't have a Tristana Q to boost his attack speed, Caitlyn passive for massive damage or a twitch ult for massive range + ad. The closest will be his severum or a stacked chakram, which is hard to manage."
2043,5e385a53841d20c9f26178b8,"The pitfall here with the D&d example isn't in the design, it's communicating the design. An enemy like that, if the players understand how the mechanic works, encourages the party to think about how they sequence their attacks. Maybe the big Barbarian shouldn't blow his load, only to have his attack mostly negated. You use a weak attack to blow the healing and then a big attack to do damage. I *like* these sorts of designs, done sparingly and correctly, because getting players to actually use their brains in combat can be an uphill battle. 

But that's assuming the party has the time and interest to discover these things. And assuming the DM is using reactions properly (one per round). And assuming the initiative order is correct.

Aphelios is the same problem, that the designers are assuming the other player has the reaction time, interest, and ability to track his guns and ammo like they would track major cool downs or mana on a mage. And the design of the game and the temperament of the players just doesn't support that assumption."
2044,5e385a53841d20c9f26178bc,"Yeah it seems that when riot designs high skill floor to high skill cap champs, they forget that the skill floor should involve mistakes leading to high moments of weakness. Look at Aurelion sol, his cap isn't that high but his floor especially in his early days was super punishing. The only ability that could bail him out of danger from a champ in melee was his ultimate, any other time he got rushed he'd have to flash or used phase rush to escape. Of every single new champ since kaisa, I can't easily think of a scenario where the champs are significantly weak. All of these new reworks and champs are designed with big high skill plays in mind without a thought for how to really make the champ require high skill defensively too. Akali might require decent practice to efficiently utilize her kit but only offensively. Her shroud E and R all give so much leeway to kite out of mistakes that the player only really has to focus on doing damage as most champs cant reliably counter her playstyle. Same goes with Irelia, Pyke, Aatrox, etc who commonly have had mechanics gutted in order to bring them in line rather than naturally being designed with these flaws that opponents can exploit in exchange for the power their skill caps give."
2045,5e385a53841d20c9f26178c0,"As far as overdesigning in general goes, your DM didn't do that bad of a job. The healing mechanic meant that offensively weaker characters would do similar damage as your main damage dealers, which theoretically could encourage a more even share of who's kicking the most ass.

In practice I can definitely see that enemy becoming nothing more than a punching bag with extra steps, but at least it's not something with 20 rules and 30 special conditions that boil down to ""just roll the dice and hope you roll high enough""."

2121,5e385a58841d20c9f26179f0,"It's not hard to tell what's going on. Literally his biggest issue is that you can't see his offhand or his ammo count. They make that clear and maybe change the color of the ultimate depending on what weapon he cast it with and he's fine visually. 


He's a fairly straightforward and easy champion to play and play against. The problem is his ""rule bending"" with long range autos when it comes to ""clarity"" on what he's doing."
2122,5e385a58841d20c9f26179f4,"Except that Jinx loses a shitton of mana with 5 rockets early. Her steroid is nothing you can force, she has to kill a champ or turret and it is only brief.
Let’s not pretend that Aphelios isn’t without any issues. I am not complaining about him, i just told you that champs like Draven and Jinx don’t get free shit, they have a clear payoff.
In the end every champ has issues in his kit, may it be stupid extra passives, to low or high numbers."
2123,5e385a58841d20c9f26179f8,"ok, now I'm confused, cause I swore his ult was a blue sem-transparent blob.  Maybe i'm wrong though."
2124,5e385a58841d20c9f26179fc,"All he must do is dodge 1 skillshot and yes, then he can 1v1 an assassin, something that most ADCs cant do"
2125,5e385a58841d20c9f2617a00,If he has the right guns he absolutely demolishes assassins. Hes one of the few adcs that can stand up to an assassin. I bet you think even draven cant 1v1 an assassin because he has barely any mobility but thats just plain wrong.
2126,5e385a58841d20c9f2617a04,"So if you added some sort of penalty to them it wouldn't be a downside, it'd be a tradeoff."
2127,5e385a58841d20c9f2617a08,Jayce has like 8 if you count all the mechanics
2128,5e385a58841d20c9f2617a0c,"Champions that are strong in proplay or super high elo and only by pro players are abomination, imagine you create a champion that can be only properly abused at top 0.1% elo by 10% players there."
2129,5e385a58841d20c9f2617a10,Its color coded to the gun he has
2130,5e385a58841d20c9f2617a14,Ironic flairs.
2131,5e385a58841d20c9f2617a18,"I'm not sure what point you're trying to make, but aphelios, just like jinx, is swapping between bonuses when he switches weapons.

There is no ""downside"" to switching weapons, just like Jinx, you're just forfeiting one bonus for another."
2132,5e385a59841d20c9f2617a1c,"imagine always creating the same simple champs over and over. let's have a game with 20 yis, garens and Annie's.

also just because they are strongest there doesn't mean everyone can have fun with them or practice them to become good."
2133,5e385a59841d20c9f2617a20,"oh my, that makes it even worse.  3 of them are like blue and bluish green variants!  Terrible color selection, I didn't even notice!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG7h9YXjK5E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG7h9YXjK5E)"
2134,5e385a59841d20c9f2617a24,Oh yes we should add 20 more akalis and kalistas to the game right? Kits that they spent several patches trying to balance but kept failing so they might as well just throw them in the gutter. You end up ruining the experience of the enemies that play against such design while also pissing off the mains for inevitably ruining their champ. Great job.
2135,5e385a59841d20c9f2617a28,"I agree that champs with high mechanics deserve to be in the game, but not every champ that isn’t Akali and Irelia is as simple as Garen. Release Akali should’ve never made it to live period."
2136,5e385a59841d20c9f2617a2c,"It is not about that.

You can't create a character for PVP game like it is PVE game with all fantasies etc.

Thing is probably hardest champion to play from recent champions Riot did is aatrox, who needs to hit every Q, every Q has delay and he needs to hit in bonus dmg fields to truly win, and after removing certain unnecessery mechanics like revival, he is champion with skill that truly applies to what you said. But he doesn't feel overloaded like other designs are.

Thing is, proplay is a bit diffrent bracket. Kalista was famous for that because abusing kalista tower diving vs enemies with organized jungler and support was crazy strong as well forcing each objective while outsmiting junglers.

And btw, some newer designs are not harder to play but easier. Playing Xayah/kaisa and mistepping is literally press R to be safe again. On older champions you are just dead."
2137,5e385a59841d20c9f2617a30,"i enjoy complex kits and those, by their pure nature, take longer to properly balance. those tend to be stronger in pro and this means they have to be worse in other ranks.

and if you enjoy the kit of a champ then you can still play them, have fun and actually get really good at them."
2138,5e385a59841d20c9f2617a34,Theres a difference between taking long and taking forever. Has kalista ever been good for the past few years?
2139,5e385a59841d20c9f2617a38,"kalista is in exactly the spot she should be in. below average in soloq partially due to her strength in coordinated play and partially because of her individual difficulty. and in pro she is an occasional pb.

maybe she could use a tiny buff but generally she is in the same spot as corki and azir. very slight changes have her in pretty good spots pro and soloq wise."
2140,5e385aa7841d20c9f2617a3d,We need to be able to see more clearly what offhand he has at the slightest of glances. It's one of the biggest problems with his (lack of) clarity.
2141,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a41,"This champ is a giant fuck you to game clarity and to every custom skin that got denied because it would ""negatively impact game clarity"""
2142,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a45,League has become cod ground war on rust.
2143,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a49,"Yeah, this has already been brought up a ton of times, but I agree. I play a decent amount of botlane and with Aphelios, it is the first time for me that I actually have problems evaluating what will happen if i initiate on him, because its just so unclear to me sometimes what weapon combo he currently has (mainly the secondary weapon is problematic obviously).

I am not super good at the game, but if even the pros have those problems, then maybe the developers should really think of some solution. In my opinion, it is even bad for the viewers experience when watching pro games, because it's just much harder to understand what is happening with Aphelios in contrary to other champions. Basically, in my opinion Aphelios kinda goes agains the like design choices that I always liked about League of Legends which were clarity and understandability of what is happening."
2144,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a4d,this champion was a mistake
2145,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a51,Kobbe got actually one-shotted the first team fight and somehow died the second.
2146,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a55,"I just accept that sometimes aphelious kills me and I have no idea why. I generally understand every single other champion in the game and can predict roughly what they'll do and how it'll hurt me.

It's just impossible to keep track of all his stupid guns and all their stupid effects and pile on effects. I hope they just nerf the shit out of him eventually so he stops being relevant."
2147,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a59,"> Change: The icons of Aphelios’s main and offhand weapons now show above his health bar to everyone.

This is what we need IMO: the fact that we can’t tell what weapons he has is why we don’t know what is R will do."
2148,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a5d,"aphelios needs no nerf, just be better than a pro player in pro games lol"
2149,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a61,There were two times I saw Kobbe die to Aphelios and had no clue how he died until they did slow-mo replay. I really dislike being clueless as to what I’m watching.
2150,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a65,Guys this is what Riot meant by highest skillcap in the game! You have to actively take advantage of the lack of clarity to maximize your effects ingame y'all are so stupid! He doesn't need a nerf you guys just need to be aware that he can do these things /s
2151,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a69,I still don't understand why Aphelios needs to get global range
2152,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a6d,Just remove this stupid champion already pending a rework
2153,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a71,"There’s a reason why he has such an insane ban rate and is a first class ADC in pro play and solo queue. The good thing is tho since he’s such a contested pick in pro play, that they’ll pay attention to him....eventually. 

But alas after 2 consecutive nerfs he will most likely still be a problem. A true abomination of a champion."
2154,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a75,"Aphelios has a beautiful design... For a PvE game like Diablo. Not for League of Legends. Please Riot just consider removing him despite the work put into it... Or just maybe make him Normal Mode only.

This champ really is FAR from clarity and does not belong in ranked at any given level of play."
2155,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a79,"It does change color depending on the gun. So that isn't enough. 

There needs to be a better visual indicator of the secondary gun, since the real problem is the ability to just switch to it right before casting R. 

I suggested previously that the guns themselves should match the color of their icon, so you could very clearly see the purple/blue/green/red/white gun on his back. But why would a good idea get traction on this sub?"
2156,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a7d,"Perma-banned in my wood-league games. I don't care if you are hovering him, I'm sending a message to riot. Enjoy my 0.000021 addition to his ban rate."
2157,5e385aa8841d20c9f2617a81,Aphelios was a mistake. Please revert like you reverted Rengar. Game is much better iwthout him in it.
2158,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617a85,"Just change his entire fucking ult.

* It has no clarity.
* It doesn't fit a marksman.
* It's not interesting.

Actually scratch that, just change the entire fucking champion."
2159,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617a89,Aphelios' weapons already have their own icons. There's no reason they can't be transposed onto the ultimate projectile
2160,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617a8d,"Honestly there's people at riot that need to be disciplined for allowing a champion in that state to be released. If they were remotely competent they would start an investigation and figure out what the fuck were the design and QA teams smoking when developing Aphelios.

Surely several people must have signed off on releasing Aphelios when he was obviously in no state to make it to PBE let alone live (his ult being the most glaring issue)."
2161,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617a91,"REMOVE THIS NIGHTMARE.

It is not a LoL Champion."
2162,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617a95,Just rework him or remove him from the game. The champ is just too chaotic.
2163,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617a99,"Riot has never ""prided itself on clarity"".

They can't write a decent tooltip to this day, despite supposedly having a function that shows all details (which it doesn't)."
2164,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617a9d,"I think the ult does change color based on weapon, but it's not very clear what the color is. For example, Calibrum is like light green, but Crescendum is white, and it's easy to mistake the two. Gravitum is purple, but Infernum is dark blue, so again it's easy to mistake the two. The only solutions I can suggest would be to change the colors (like, Infernum could be yellow or something, Calibrum a different (neon??) green), or add the weapon icon somewhere on the ult projectile (since it's a crescent, it can go in the concave part at the back).

Aphelios has an icon next to his health bar for his current main-hand weapon, so there is some clarity there. The only issue is that his off-hand weapon is hidden. This is arguably okay, since you can't expect a champion to give away everything to the enemy (e.g. it's like not knowing enemy champ's cooldowns, but you know what spells they possibly have), but some Q effects should definitely get extra indicators. For example, the turret could have an icon of what gun it's using to fire. If you can see Aphelios' model, I think the two guns he has does show on him (the off-hand is on his back or something), but that's just way too had to see and react to in an actual game."
2165,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617aa1,"I like how Aphelios was meant to be the Invoker of LoL, yet they managed to instantly strip down every bit of skill expression and added a bunch of unclear visuals to the mix. My biggest problem with aphelios is that while its really hard to know and remember all that he does, it practically plays itself. Invoker has to remember all the spell combinations, Aphelios just autoattacks, presses Q and occasionally R on one of the two weapons that happen to be in his hands."
2166,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617aa5,"Was thinking about making a similair post. Just in the TSM game at least 3 bullshit aphelios plays happened. I bet everyone tried to learn aphelios in and out but still it's so hard to see in a flash what that champ is capable off in a specific moment.

I think its a massive oversight by the champ design cause something like this should just not exist."
2167,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617aa9,Maybe they can change it so its clear what guns aphelios has? Like maybe his guns can have a color coded aura?
2168,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617aad,I don't understand how they arent telling you what off hand gun he has. like the off hand gun's as important if not even more important than the main gun so you just end up getting destroyed while not knowing by what or how to play against it. Literally the champion is only good because you don't know against which of the 15 abilities you should prepare yourself for
2169,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617ab1,"Newer champions are just becoming far too complicated in a game that relies on knowing what to expect at any given moment.

could you imagine being in a game against 5 champions with the capability of having like 10 different attacks each?"
2170,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617ab5,"The fact he went through like his is embarassing, even for Riot's abysmal standards. He needed to be pulled off the game immediately, apologies issued, and reworked from scratch. Been saying it since day 1."
2171,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617ab9,"To fix this, I say we make a petition to have the first champion ever removed from league of legends become Aphelios."
2172,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617abd,"He said ""Not being able to see what it's about to do"" a total of 5 times."
2173,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617ac1,"Right now it's tough to gauge. There are indicators for what is going to happen, but league is such a cluster of animations that it's tough to see everything all the time. Eventually player skill will increase or riot will address this issue and trim down and simplify animations (without compromising quality.)"
2174,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617ac5,CertainlyT has caused more cancer with his champions than asbestos
2175,5e385aa9841d20c9f2617ac9,I noticed that too. Really bad that pro players can't even tell what Aphelios is capable of.
2176,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617acd,I think Aphelious in general sucks and already needs a rework because that is ridiculous.
2177,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617ad1,"Yeah... I was playing Aphelios earlier today and I was duo with a friend. We engage in a 2v2 in lane and I just did all the things and auto killed the enemy laners. I was just like, ""This is so stupid. What is going on, like what the fuck am I even doing right now?""  It was just a blur of projectiles tbh."
2178,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617ad5,"Going to say, i disagreed with this statement at first.  But after watching the game i agree.  I play aphilious and so can usually tell what weapons and what combos are available.  But after watching this game there were several times where he ultied from Fog of war and i had to rewind to see what was actually happening because the visuals are so tiny and hard to differentuate."
2179,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617ad9,this champion ruins professional play if not even the professionals can counter it
2180,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617add,"Honestly I consider the champion a complete failure, bad design"
2181,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617ae1,"The ult does have color corresponding to it tho. Red for sev, green for Cali, blue for infern, purp for grab and white for chak.

Edit: the reason gragas used his hourglass was because it was a calibrum, he was going to get killed by the long range auto. The casters were giving their opinion, in this case they were wrong."
2182,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617ae5,"I don't care about clarity. I know what he does when i'm giving it my all and focusing. It's just too much. His chakram damage is flat out waaay to high, and I don't think the nerfs on the pbe come remotely close to where he needs to be in terms of damage output. His infernum damage in teamfights is beyond crazy. His AOE CC and unavoidable cc in general also needs to be tuned. 

Honestly, a lot of the issue is with how ""well designed"" his kit is. His Q adding offhand weapon effects gives him waaay too much versatility. Like how pretty much every Q sets up his root if you have it offhand."
2183,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617ae9,"Just refund everyone who owns this champ, give blue essence to all players for having to play against this bullshit and Riot can officially remove this champ of the game they intended to remove Vladmire at one point but at least Vlad isn’t as cancerous as Aphelious"
2184,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617aed,"This is more for people who have no clue what he does. List goes from Overall passive, to weapon passive, to Q’s, to W, and ending with Ults. I can answer most questions, but not ones regarding how to stack chakarums, long post warning.

 He passive is The hitman and the seer. He rotates through 5 weapons every 50 autos or 5 Q’s. Used weapons will move to the back of the rotation.The default rotation is Calibrum, Serverum, Gravitum, Infernum, and Crecendum. You can change the rotation based on what you run out of first. Cailbrum is long ranged, serverum is life steal, gravitum is a slow, Infernum is Aoe, and crecendum attacks faster at close range.

Each weapon has a unique passive. Calibrum’s autos will mark an enemy champion which can be consumed by auto attacking them. Severum’s autos heal per auto attack and will grant a small overhead shield. Gravitum’s autos slow and mark an enemy champion. The mark is used for its Q. Infernum’s autos deal 110% physical damage and will splash 4 bolts in a small come behind the target. Crecendum’s is if Aphelios uses an ability where he would need to throw creseidum, he will instead throw a tiny version of it that stacks up to 20.

Each weapon uses 10 ammo for Q. You can use the off-hands Q while the main hand’s Q is on cool down.  Calibrums Q is a mark that you can consume by auto attacking. Serverum’s Q is an automatic fast paced switch between your man hand and off hand weapons. This will lock auto attacks while the spell is active. Gravitum’s Q is a one second root that will do damage. This can only be activated when gravitum’s mark is on an enemy. Infernum Q is a splash of Aoe in a small cone shape. Crecendum Q places a turret of your off hand weapon that also will place the offhand’s passive on an enemy when hit.

W just swaps between the main and off hand weapons.

Each weapon has a different ult passive. Calibrums marks all champions hit and will do bonus damage when consumed. Serverum will heal him for 200/300/400 health of an enemy is hit. Gravidum slows for 99% for a bit. Infernum’s splash will attack in a circle around that champ instead of a cone dealing 75% of the ult damage. You can take overlapping splash damage ( Do NOT group when he has this ult. It’s the strongest one and will do a buttload of damage before you can move.) Cercendum’s will just spawn 3 extra chakarums. 

Gesh this was like writing an essay. It took like 30 minutes."
2185,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617af1,"Can we all just admit that this champ is the worst designed champ in ages -- possibly ever? Like, this shit shouldn't have been released in anything remotely resembling its current form. Full stop."
2186,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617af5,The problem in my opinion is that we can't see the off-hand weapon
2187,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617af9,Just play mundo then lol no problem then
2188,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617afd,Bro just use your eyes
2189,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617b01,Just fire CertainlyT while you’re at it because it’s literally not the first time his champ is way too cancerous in the game
2190,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617b05,"A little late but I stopped playing league a couple of years ago, usually when a new champ comes out it's confusing at first but after a couple of games you can tell what he does, but I still don't understand any single of Aphelios abilities."
2191,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617b09,"The release of Aphelios is the first time that I have actually finally thought that League might have too many champions. If something like this can be released as a marksman, then I am terrified of the next champion (Sett is really good though)"
2192,5e385aaa841d20c9f2617b0d,"Root balance team is a joke, give us 5 bans pr player or stop clowning around. Just because Senna is also broken asf does not mean it's okay for Aphelios to be. Just fix your shitty game pls."
2193,5e385aab841d20c9f2617b11,"Just fucking burn the entire champion and start over. This guy has no redeeming features. Rather bland gameplay, edgy as fuck, cringeworthy beyond reason in both model and VO. While he's not exactly OP for soloQ, there's simply *no reason* for Aphelios to exist."
2194,5e385aab841d20c9f2617b15,I can't even tell if his ult hit a certain champion when it hits a group of champions.
2195,5e385aab841d20c9f2617b19,"Speaking of clarity, did people forget about Riven? I see so many people here talk about clarity, clarity, clarity, clarity, that's what needs to be chanegd about apphelios! and then you got riven, tell me what clarity is there in riven dumping her entire kit on you in 1 second? you can be fighting a ''normal''riven who takes a couple of seconds to unload a kit on you and you can think ''ah I see, she has to cast several abilities and then finish it off with her ultimate which can give me couple seconds time to reposition or flash away'' then next time you fight a animation cancelling riven you blow up in 1 second and all you're thinking is ''?????'' like I get Riven is popular but nothing's stopping you from reworking or nerfing her."
2196,5e385aab841d20c9f2617b1d,"I can always understand what the ult did, after I saw it, but never before."
2197,5e385aab841d20c9f2617b21,High skillcap? I think rioters was high when they were designing him.
2198,5e385aab841d20c9f2617b25,"Everytime i see Aphelious fire his ult i think ""What will it do this time"""

2201,5e385aab841d20c9f2617b31,"I feel like Aphelios is just problematic by nature. He's a champion you need to know very well to be able to play against, kinda like playing melee against a Darius but Darius's kit is super complex and not at all obvious."

2205,5e385aab841d20c9f2617b41,I still don't understand his kit. Saw the spotlight and read about it but gave up
2206,5e385aab841d20c9f2617b45,I still permaban him as supp main. I prefer that to banning counters. Fuck aphelios.
2207,5e385aab841d20c9f2617b49,Aphelios should be disabled for pro play and perhaps also unavailable.
2208,5e385aab841d20c9f2617b4d,"Lmao as a coming back player that's not the only problem I had - like 8 of the last released champions are confusing as fuck and have super annoying mechanics

2211,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b59,"I think clarity is something they completely missed with Aphelios. His ult should probably have different collars depending on the weapon he uses. Also, there needs to be a clearer indication what kind of weapon he is carrying on his back."
2212,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b5d,The ult DOES change color basee on the weapon.
2213,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b61,"remember how they gave aatrox the ugliest, poorly-made-kids'-toy looking wings ever because of an interaction he had with Conq (okay, fair, but probably fixable) and zhonyas (why would you ever buy that on aatrox)?

riot doesn't know the MEANING of clarity."
2214,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b65,Remember when they didn't put a walking animation for the lancer blitz skins cause of clarity? lmao
2215,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b69,"Why does he need an ultimate in the first place? He already has global range auto attacks, cleave, lifesteal, poke, burst.

Boi got 5 abilities already."
2216,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b6d,"Somewhere, CertainlyT is rubbing himself raw over another toxic champion design."
2217,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b71,"I say it again, at this point I, as a trash gold player, have not the slightest idea what this champion can or cannot do and when. If you don't play him it's near to impossible to know this complexity...."
2218,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b75,"Clearity is a thing riot doesn't care for since 2 or 4 years?
They are throwing their own dogmas overboard."
2219,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b79,Even though I love this hero I have to agree. I simply can't count how many times I have killed enemies on bot lane because enemy support engages on me while I have infernum with chakram hidden in my offhand. People must be able to tell which weapon is in main hand and which is in the offhand. Weapon queue should still remain hidden.
2220,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b7d,One of the good things about being in low elo is consistently taking a hot dump on any aphelios I lane against because almost nobody knows how to even play him that well at low elo.
2221,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b81,"it gets even worse when you take into account that you can't see his ammo or the weapon he will get upon depleting his main hand weapon.

So if both weapons are very low on ammo he can basically choose between 4 different Rs and you can only guess what 3 of those are."
2222,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b85,"One of my big complaints about Aphelios, has always been the ulti projectile itself. It doesn't look like a projectile, it's like a zone, reminds me of old stealth games like Sly Cooper and Mark of the Ninja where enemies have very distinct cones of vision you have to avoid."
2223,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b89,"Isn't his ult just a long range shot that 'explode' when it hits the enemy (and explode again)

Or is there more to it? I thought the ult was the easy part to understand on the champ lol. The rest I have no idea"
2224,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b8d,"just destroy that champion man, and fire the team that designed his kit."
2225,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b91,I’m ready for them to remove this champ tbh
2226,5e385aac841d20c9f2617b95,"Honestly IMO the Burdon of knowledge this champ imposes on all ten players is a cool concept by itself, but when you take into account how many champs there are and how much more complex the game gets every year with things like dragon soul and RH It makes this champ unbearable for me to play against."
2227,5e385aad841d20c9f2617b99,"i ban him every game so i don't have to understand him, i'm lazy"

2230,5e385aad841d20c9f2617ba5,"It’s funny you think Riot has the capacity or pride required to be embarrassed about anything involving its spaghetti coded, balance train wreck, toxic cesspool of a game."
2231,5e385aad841d20c9f2617ba9,Why does aphelios have cc at all?
2232,5e385aad841d20c9f2617bad,"I suggest taking him out of league and putting him in the Shooter game Riot is developing. He was an interesting experiment but deviates too far from the fundamental QWER setup of the game. Even if players could ""play him 2 or 3 times"" to understand him enough to counter him, it's unreasonable to expect players to learn entirely new mechanics and control schemes for individual champions in a PVP game with almost 150 playable characters. That's rough for veterans - just imagine being a new player trying to get into a game like that."
2233,5e385aad841d20c9f2617bb1,I can't tell what abilities or champion a skin  has/is half the time anymore. These newer skins have a huge clarity problem. The reason why it wasn't a problem with Ultimate skins in the past is because they were few and very special.
2234,5e385aad841d20c9f2617bb5,"The ult does change colour based on what weapon he has...

Although i agree you should be able to see which offhand he has without looking at his character model. It should be on hi HP info bar somewhere."
2235,5e385aad841d20c9f2617bb9,I'm gonna need an official textbook released by Riot to begin to understand Aphelios' kit
2236,5e385aad841d20c9f2617bbd,"You can't even tell which weapon he has in offhand, and the main hand is also hard unless you memorize every picture of the weapon. So you have to wait for him to AA or use an ability to know.

On top of that, there are so many interactions and lack of clarity you never know what he is going to do. Fuck that champion, I just gave up trying to understand and just try hardest to CC lock him down and burst him, because Can't really play aroudn what you don't understand."
2237,5e385aad841d20c9f2617bc1,"Man i dont want to be bothered learning aphelios to get into the game/into ranked.
It may sound stupid but i dont want to *study* a damn champion.

His adition made the game less fun for everyone and slightly more fun for anyone who is willing to learn him, and is a *clear* sign on riots ""new"" design philosophy(that sucks ass)

IMO the games complexity should come from the players making the most out of simple(but creative) kits and intresting item passives/actives and their synergy, team plays, strategy, map buffs etc... small things that may seem simple but end up being complex on macro."
2238,5e385aad841d20c9f2617bc5,All you need to do is set clear color differences on ult animation. Peoples will get used to it.
2239,5e385aad841d20c9f2617bc9,Complaining about the clarity of his kit is completely valid in my opinion. Complaining about his kit in general just seems so cringe because he just has a little too much damage a simple nerf is enough. If you admit that you do not know what a champion does you admit to not being able to learn something and idk what to tell you then...
2240,5e385aad841d20c9f2617bcd,All the bronze players out in force tonight.
2241,5e385aad841d20c9f2617bd1,It might just be me but I think it does damage
2242,5e385aad841d20c9f2617bd5,Just have the icon for the mainhand gun appear as an icon above him when he ults
2243,5e385aad841d20c9f2617bd9,Imagine already understanding majority of Aphelios' abilities and only struggling with his ult...
2244,5e385aae841d20c9f2617bdd,"once Riot stopped finding champs to steal from dota, it looks like they just started making amalgamations of older champs."
2245,5e385aae841d20c9f2617be1,Why dont they just change the color of the ult to the gun he has? and then maybe slow down the ult
2246,5e385aae841d20c9f2617be5,i guess he is not a very clear and cut champion to verse so i think this is actually a good idea.
2247,5e385aae841d20c9f2617be9,assume that he has every gun available then you won't be surprised
2248,5e385aae841d20c9f2617bed,"As a dota player enjoying trying out league not being able to readily see what the scaling on your abilities are and what changes when you level them up (besides when you level them) is so foreign and doesn’t really promote understanding why some abilities are better than others 

I know this has nothing really to do with your post but the idea of clarity in the game without information like that is odd"
2249,5e385aae841d20c9f2617bf1," im with you, but just so you know - the ult's color do change based on the primary weapon. its just hard to notice it in a fight but if you try looking at it you can see it does change

as someone who has 60k mastery on aphe, i think the biggest clarity issue he has right now is that you have no way of knowing which secondary weapon he has apart from looking at his back, but theres no UI indicator for it and his secondary weapon is actually MORE dangerous than his primary. the most important thing to remember while being against aphelios IMO is basically every time he uses a skill apart from Gravitum (purple CC gun) he will do his PRIMARY's active and SECONDARY's passive"
2250,5e385aae841d20c9f2617bf5,Just give the ult dofferent colors (the ring) purple for slow red for lifesteal blue for fore green sniper white boomerang. Would be hard for skins but soable i believe.
2251,5e385aae841d20c9f2617bf9,"Aphelios is maybe the champion with the least clarity in the game, but at least the animations mostly look cool. His ult is unclear AND has a boring animation."

2257,5e385aae841d20c9f2617c11,I can definitely think of some abilities that I dont know what they are gonna do even after seeing it. But then again I'm a noob that's doesnt know ever champions abilities.

2267,5e385aaf841d20c9f2617c39,Why would they do it? You can check which weapons are loaded. If you indicate his ultimate why not show the CD everyone has on their abilities? Because then you'll literally see everything he has. You have a problem with predictability? Welcome to League of Legends theres a lot you can't predict for sure. There are champs who's cd resets on a few secs if they get a kill you need an indicator for that as well? There's crit which is based on probability and you can't tell if an aa is going to deal 200 dmg or 400 dmg. Need an indicator for that too?
2268,5e385aaf841d20c9f2617c3d,the game is trash thats what needs to change

Pros are making tons of mistakes on aphelious anyways... it makes sence they can not know what he will do, especially if they have never played him due to being in another roll."

2281,5e385ab0841d20c9f2617c71,"Or just remove the champ entirely. The problem with adding more champs to a game that already has too many champs is that the new champions must be released with more and more complexity just to be viable. You get caught in this loop where champs become more and more overloaded then we get something like aphelios which is just disgusting.

&#x200B;

My main problem with Aphelios is that I don't know what niche he is supposed to fill. I'm not a huge fan of Senna either, but at least Riot was trying to make a more utility focused adc that could be played support. Granted I don't think that's great game design, but at least they were trying to fill a role. It feels like Aphelios's role is just being better than every other adc in the game by confusing everyone"
2282,5e385ab0841d20c9f2617c75,"He should just get some visual and hud updates tbh, preferably updates that focus on letting the rest of the players in game know which primary and off-hand he has more clearly."
2283,5e385ab0841d20c9f2617c79,I never know what Aphelios is doing. It's nice to know I'm exactly as good as the pros. Expect to see me at worlds.

2285,5e385ab0841d20c9f2617c81,"I honestly hate everything about aphelios and his design. I'm all for a complex, high skill cap champion, but I don't even think riot achieved that. I'm pretty sure he's far easier to play than they intended and he's just poorly designed from the perspective of playing against him."

2289,5e385ab0841d20c9f2617c91,More coloring on his abilities to match so if that color Ult comes out you know what to expect.

2291,5e385ab0841d20c9f2617c99,He needs a Global UI for everyone at all time even when he is in fog of war. The fact he got released and his alowed in pro play without it is beyond me this guy release and the state of balance confirmed some of my thought on league of legends it is now the newbie ground at Riot they moved the good vet to other project and lost some of them. I read an article that they where hiring more base on diversity then talent now it shows. And im all for diversity just dont hire bad people. I didnt think that whole scandal thing was that big it is that big. Now it seems no one with talent is willing to work for them or they just dont hire them due to a diversity agenda.
2292,5e385ab0841d20c9f2617c9d,"speaking of clarity, is anyone else confusing this star guardian Zoe skin with Cosmic Dusk Xayah or have I just not played in a while?"
2293,5e385ab0841d20c9f2617ca1,"What can the enemy team do differently if they know which ult is going to hit then?

I have no idea how aphelio works."
2294,5e385ab0841d20c9f2617ca5,So we can see Jhin's 4th shot but can't see Aphelio's guns that have a million different things going on?
2295,5e385ab0841d20c9f2617ca9,What makes it even worse is that it's not like the champion is fringe.  It's a meta champ that I assume the scrim all day with and they still don't know what he does.
2296,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617cad,I knew Aphelios would be a huge problem before he came out. There's too much mental load trying to figure out what his gun combination and effects are especially during a 5v5 team fight.
2297,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617cb1,But his ult is differently colored based on gun. It's just that the color is so fucking transparent that it's almost impossible to notice in the middle of a fight
2298,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617cb5,I think the color coded ult is the best possible solution for this. It's the only thing that needs an actual clarity update as of now imo
2299,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617cb9,"how do YOU know they dont know? i mean it isnt a mystery what his ult does, just read up on his kit. the ult color literally does change with the color of his gun so yea."
2300,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617cbd,Please remove this abomination of a champion permanently
2301,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617cc1,TBH the whole idea of aphelios would make more sense as a zaunite champ. It would be easier to communicate his current state if his visual design didn't require elegance and simplicity
2302,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617cc5,LMAO here we go again Reddit...
2303,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617cc9,Why can people not see his ability's Like it's really not that difficult to distinguish what each weapon and combo does.
2304,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617ccd,I have no idea what he does when I play against him lol I just wait for jungle ganks and hope to oneshot him before he kills my Volibear with just dorans blade and a potion xD

2306,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617cd5,I'm convinced aphelios is proof that RIOT is running out of ideas for champs.
2307,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617cd9,Fun Idea. Pull him from the game for 2-4 weeks and rework his passive as a pseudo ultimate skin. Each gun he has changes his base skin's color. You can pick which color is for what gun but the effects should also carry over to his abilities so if you see a purple ultimate flying at you you know it's a about to do x etc.
2308,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617cdd,"unrelated to aphelios but on the topic of clarity, when the fuck will we get clientside options to disable skins? i dont care if people want to spend hundreds of dollars on skins but half of them have extremely ambiguous or confusing animations, I really dont want to see that stuff"

2311,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617ce9,"Honestly I wish they'd just go ahead and rework him, I'd respect the heck out of that."
2312,5e385ab1841d20c9f2617ced,"I hate aphelios. If this were a PvE game the kit would be better, but the champ is so impossible to predict when he’s in a game, and the “ghost levels” he gets are ridiculous. 

It’s a shame riot allowed this champ to be made, because they denied some really awesome other champ designs in the name of clarity along the way."
2313,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617cf1,"This champ honestly just needs to get erased from League, I get it, it’s a entirely new champ and I give props to Riot for trying out new things, but this champ is just way to overloaded with no clarity of anything."
2314,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617cf5,"As a once semi-consistent league of legends player, the two things stopping me from returning to league: Aphelious and what he represents.

Power creep, champs being only fun for the person playing it, few options for use in micro, macro and draft answers for the enemy draft- all of these, from what I gather, are practically synonymous with aphelios. 

I played in season 3, and I remover that things weren't perfect balance-wise, but so long as you were a better player you always had a natural leg up on the enemy regardless of what champ you played. I mean this was the case to a certain degree, a 10/10 kassadin could destroy a 10/10 xiliean, but the difference seemed more fair than an aphelios just bringing objectively more to the table than a champ like a sivir.

Idk, I could go on but I'm just mad that riot put out yet another poorly balanced champ that takes away from the game as opposed to, you know, making the game more fun for the people who regularly play it."
2315,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617cf9,I've stopped playing the game but I have been playing it on and off since season 1 until the end of season 9. I think I might not come back this time because riot keeps releasing more and more champions with ridiculous kits.
2316,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617cfd,"The worst part of Aphelios, putting aside obvious clarity issues, is his unexplored depths.

Right now Aph is pretty pick or ban status. Which means we're not learning that much about what Aph is capable of doing because his playrate is suppressed by his banrate. All the crazy gimmicks Aph is currently well known for are also floating at the top providing such good value nobody needs to find the _next_ trick in Aphs arsenal.


...and Aph absolutely has more up his sleeve. They'll nerf the most obvious parts then something else will go pop off. Has there been much talk about how powerful his red gun's Q is for example?"

2319,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617d09,"While Aphelios is a cool design on paper and in mind, it doesn’t mean it needed to become a reality. 

I stand by my initial opinion that’ll he’ll forever broken or gutted. There’s too many moving parts that’ll ever have him in a balanced/fair state."
2320,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617d0d,I'd be perfectly happy if they just removed this champ.  Aside from all the issues.. he is just is not fun to play against.  I mean all I know about him is that he is not mobile but I have no idea which guns he has or what they do or how much damage.  I miss the days that Riot actually released champs that were easy to read and easy to play but difficult to master.
2321,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617d11,"I'm honestly in for new champs and stuff, and never have felt this had with a new champ, but with Aphelios, man... I feel like he is just out of place, completely different to all champs, even a weird UI feed. 

He's just odd as fuck and not even similar to an usual marksman"
2322,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617d15,I think the change is to delete him and use all the good ideas they shoved all into one body and spread them out across multiple champions in the future.
2323,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617d19,"Even the Aphelios player does not know what his abilities do. Any other champion after a few games you can easily understand their kits. This champion just needs to be deleted from the game, zero clarity with a grossly overloaded kit due to the weapon/ability swaps."
2324,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617d1d,https://clips.twitch.tv/MagnificentPluckyCucumberFrankerZ
2325,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617d21,"There was 2-3 times in the TSM game they had no idea what Aphelious ult did. One time where Kobbe got one shot with all sums and ults up and Dardoch using hourglass for no reason because he had no idea as well.

That is ridiculous"
2326,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617d25,Remove him and fix Galio.
2327,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617d29,"I never flame Riot when champions first come out, but this champion has got to be one of the worst quality assurance cases ever produced. I feel there so desperate to release a unique champion that they ignore feedback provided by the community

Need to hot fix him immediately and not wait."
2328,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617d2d,I think Aphelios is an anti-League champion. His design doesn’t lend itself to being intuitive in any way and if that is impacting the highest level of play then there needs to be some sort of change.
2329,5e385ab2841d20c9f2617d31,"Unwatchable nonsense champ

WE OWL NOW BOYS"
2330,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d35,"In laning phase, managing how you play based on what guns the enemy aphelios has seems reasonable(I dislike having to even do that but I agree that it's reasonable). Late game though? It's really hard to keep track of his guns especially when he's constantly swapping them while in fog. Pair this with the fact that his ult range is so long and you are sometimes getting blasted from far away with little signs of what could have led to that outcome, and he can be pretty confusing to play against..."
2331,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d39,"Just delete the hero and try again next time, and reel in this CertainT guy because he is off the rails with his designs and needs SOME restrictions to prevent such stupid shit from being put onto live."
2332,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d3d,"haven't seen aphelios much at all because me and my friends always ban him.  
TIL people seriously want him removed from the game, much more than any champ in the past iirc."
2333,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d41,Delete the champ. Just afmit you fucked up and delete the champ.
2334,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d45,Aphelios is a failed experiment. I never have a clue what he is doing or what he can do at any time. It shouldn't be such a confusing guessing game especially when the majority of the playerbase is casual.
2335,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d49,"Funny thing is that even if years go by I'll still have no fucking clue what the champion does. I wish Riot was more willing to delete/rework/whatever if things go wrong, no matter how much time and effort you put into it. The concept is cool and all, but why 5 guns? You can do 2 and actually give different abilities to them. Would be infinitely better to play and to play vs."
2336,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d4d,Just remove the champion.
2337,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d51,"I look out for the fire gun and sometimes the gravitum and hope he keeps his current ones for a long time  
make ~~s it eaiser~~  brain hurt less  
fire = 1v9 mode and team wipe wombo combo  
purple goop = stunned at somepoint and ""outskilled"" to death  
the character is still bullshit though i've had him go 0/5 and still be relevant in a teamfight after laning phase.  
He feels more like a boss in another game rather than a champion with the ***BUT WAIT THERE'S ANOTHER HEALTH BAR*** but with weapons being constantly pulled out of his ass"
2338,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d55,"I've played aphelios twice, and I still don't know what I am going to do, so there's no way the other team knows."
2339,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d59,dude why does aphelios have like 5 different weapons what the heck.?
2340,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d5d,"Just scrap the champ imo, just makes everyone mad. 

I barely even play actual league now because of just how bizzare and how hard it is to keep up with all the new mechanics. I dont want to have to study a game to play it casually."
2341,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d61,"I do agree it is a little hard to tell what guns he has, but if you closely or observe what gun he been using recently, you can take a guess. Also, I keep hearing people use the excuse not knowing what a new champion does, just fucking go into practice tool and learn what his abilities does. I keep playing with people who doesn’t even know any of his abilities complaining about some random bullshit. Use your challenger eyes and observe the champion instead of just using your iron mouth and complaining."
2342,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d65,">Im watching EG vs TSM, and twice now the enemy team lose fights/cooldowns because aphelious ult does something those players don't expect.

That is their fault lol"
2343,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d69,"Aphelios really needs to be reworked to an entirely different theme, wanna keep the overloaded kit with 5 fucking weapons that change every abilities effects? Alright.


 BUT WHY THE FUCK IS EVERYTHING PURPLE AND WHITE? He should not have been a moon-based champion, he should've been Ionian or something based with elements so you could vary his colors"
2344,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d6d,CertainlyT: NEVER AGAIN.
2345,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d71,also remove heimerdinger
2346,5e385ab3841d20c9f2617d75,"What Aphelios needs: 

1. Second gun icon added to his HP bar. Right now you can only see his main-hand weapon. 

2. Change the effects on his ult to make the color of his gun pop out more and make it look more menacing. His flamethrower ult honestly doesn't look like it one shots you."
2347,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617d79,Riot doesn't care about the players
2348,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617d7d,"I think this is getting a little whiny. It could have more clarity, but it’s not like pro players don’t know. Abilities get lost in chaos, and there was a fuckload of chaos in that fight where kobbe got 60-0"
2349,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617d81,[deleted]
2350,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617d85,"Colour coding the ultimate and showing via colour, main and off hand via champion display image, would help a lot."
2351,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617d89,"I have a problem when it's hard to tell what aphelios off hand weapon is. It's easier to tell what is main weapon is from its look of the weapon, the attack of the weapon and the symbol next to his health bar. That being said its really hard to tell the off hand which is a problem because half of the abilities depend on the off hand weapon. They either need to add more clarity or remove the parts of abilities which are dependent on the off hand weapons"
2352,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617d8d,I would love to see the symbol of his primary weapon blatantly flash over head when he switches weapon and uses his ult
2353,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617d91,I didn't even know that Aphelios has 5 different ults... This champion is not for me.
2354,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617d95,[deleted]
2355,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617d99,The recently released champs have been very unpleasant. Yumi and now Aphelious. Their designs are supposed to be unique but it just causes more issues and frustration that overshadows their intended purpose. Seriously who's giving the greenlight on these releases? How does the play test team let Aphelious through??
2356,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617d9d,Riots gone to shit honestly. It just seems like they don’t care about a lot of things anymore.
2357,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617da1,Champion like Aphelious are made and will be made to fight the scripting issue.
2358,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617da5,"How about they just don't make such complicated champions? 

Seems like a simple fix."
2359,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617da9,I dont play anymore.  what does it to?
2360,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617dad,"A nice change would be to show both guns that you have next to your health bar, as the hotbar indicator is so tiny it's just easier to switch guns to see rather than actually looking."
2361,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617db1,Change the color of the ult depending on the gun?
2362,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617db5,Remove him
2363,5e385ab4841d20c9f2617db9,That champ is beyond busted. Riot should be ashamed they charge money for rp and skins. They clearly are done with league if they are ok with the game in this state.
2364,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617dbd,"Aphelios is the worst designed champion in League of Legends from my point of view. I would argue he may even be just objectively the worst.

First, Aphelios's design fails because the supposedly complex kit doesn't actually demand a lot from the player at it's core. The central reason as to why is that each weapon's ability has extremely limited interaction with the abilities of other weapon's. We are given the illusion of a deeply connected kit since three out of five of his Q abilities result in an auto attack from the off hand weapon. However, thinking purely about following up one weapon's ability with another ability, there's not any sort of direct synergy. If you use chakram q and follow it up with flamethrower q you've simply used two abilities that are strong on their own, and are generally just extra damage and auto attacks. The extent of making proper usage of the abilities is whether or not the enemy is in range of the flamethrower and putting the turret down in a spot that maximizes its attacks. The most in depth ability is his ult, where the player simply has to make the decision between two options.

Secondly, the ult itself is very confusing to other players, since you need to know what weapon he is currently holding to determine it's impact.

Finally, he just doesn't feel great to play as or against. When you play him you don't feel that you're actually being demanded to think creatively, you're simply pressing q on your current weapon and playing to it's strength. Against him he just barfs up a huge array of different auto attack animations based on each weapon, and was way overturned coming out of the gates (and seems to still be too strong)."
2365,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617dc1,200 years guys
2366,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617dc5,Maybe ~~add some colors to the ult based on the weapons he has so its not impossible to tell what his ult is about to do even if he was from fog of war.~~ remove him from this game as he does not belong in it.
2367,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617dc9,i will repeat what i said in the other post. If you don't know what his ult does then you have 70 iq. :)
2368,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617dcd,"Riot be jumping the gun with alot of new chars to be honest, its not very sustainable for a big sport to keep changing the balance like this, in fact for pro play the roaster could even be limited as to remove a lot of broken champs. I think the main goal should be to have a perfectly balanced roaster for pro play and not a ever growing one."
2369,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617dd1,I predict Aphelios will be the first champion Riot retracts and takes back to the drawing board.
2370,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617dd5,"> Im watching EG vs TSM 

And that's where the problem lies. Unless EG is *significantly* better than what I've seen of the LCS so far this year (which is IMT vs TSM and the first two ""highlights"" of game 1 of week two), people in the LCS don't have a clue what they're doing. Not even flame, I really want to watch NA and I really want them to improve and contest the other three big regions, but... it just doesn't look good. At all."
2371,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617dd9,"All these people saying there’s no strat on Aphelios despite the fact my best plays on him were when I actually did think about it and got creative (purposely draining through a gun to get to a specific combo sooner for example). 

All the people saying he’s busted not playing as him enough to figure it out (ANY KIND OF CC AND HE’S FUCKIN TOAST)

and before you say anything about people who learn him and play him being fine with it... I learned him and dropped it. I’m support/jungle. I just put two and two together instead of one and one like every other champ. 

Think harder.

I totally agree his ult needs some clarity adjustments though. All the autos have a unique projectile, wouldn’t be hard to overlay that with the ult projectile somehow."
2372,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617ddd,"Holy shit y’all should stop whining, this champ is nothing like akali. Aphelion only problem is his lack of clarity, which can be easily fixed by some visual Information what his offhand is, the rest is in you if you are to lazy to learn what he does"
2373,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617de1,"So many people in this thread are complaining about not understanding or seeing what Aphelios can do, it seems like so many people here just do not put in the time to understand the champion at all...  


At the start of pre-season I spammed the shit out of Aphelios with Prototype: Omnistone. I had no idea how it would work out, but I put in time and effort into learning what the champ and rune is capable of. Maybe many people here can decide to do the same. Yes, league has many champs and it takes time and commitment to understand what all champs can do, but if you have a passion for League, I strongly suggest you put in the same time and effort to at least have a feel for what every champ can do.  


When you know how to be cautious or play around certain champs, you'll learn to play around them and against them."
2374,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617de5,you forgot one crucial part. Its NA pro players that don't know what Aphelios does... and we all know its clown fiesta up there
2375,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617de9,"Aphelios is absolutely destroying the viewing experience, I cannot stand him at all. Between LEC and LCS, I’ve zoned out of so many games where there is an Aphelios. It’s just not enjoyable to watch.  

I realize I have never played him, but they fee times I’ve faced him, I just went hard range in him so I could shut down whatever he was about to do, not that I know what it is."
2376,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617ded,Theyd rather nerf him anymore even though he wasnt even the best adc on 10.2. You need to be able to see his offhand and they need change the ult into a clear skillshot that you can actually sidestep. I think they also did not adress his infernum aas yet which are beyond broken.
2377,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617df1,"Please stop meming about clarity, Riot only used that for a couple of patches in one season because it was a buzzword at the time. In those patches they even made changes that hurt clarity so no they never cared about that"
2378,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617df5,It already is color coded
2379,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617df9,The people I see complain about him seem to be the ones getting frustrated because they can't play him.
2380,5e385ab5841d20c9f2617dfd,"Have to agree, this is sloppy as fuck. Makes NA look even worse than usual."
2381,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e01,"The main problem with aphelios is he comes onto the screen and you're already in range. His ultimate is a point and click 1575 range ability. If he has the correct gun combination out you're already dead the moment you're out of fog of war. That's not a clarity issue that's just stupid.

&#x200B;

His range needs to be nerfed, or his ult needs to become a skillshot. I don't want to have to flash his spotlight to avoid it when theres no way of telling if its meaningless or if its going to kill me."
2382,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e05,"Please, Pro's can't tell what their own champions do half the time. That's the only explanation for half the shit they do in any given game. 

I've seen more Orianna shockwaves nuke an entire team than I have Aphelios do anything. And Orianna has been around for so long and been in every meta, that you'd think people would figure out what the ball does."
2383,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e09,"That was from out of vision with a 3 item aphelios. 
The ult gives one free auto per champ hit (ult passive) + Runnans gives the auto one proc. 4 autos + 4 runann proc + ult damage + infernum splash = insta kill. Yeah he didn’t expect that much damage, of this I’m sure. But that is on him for not anticipating the damage more than anything else.

Edit: Meant to reply to bottom thread."
2384,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e0d,"Lol is Aphelios really that bad? The ult does damage, just dodge, like any other skillshot."
2385,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e11,I agree 100%. OP is a clear example of someone hit by Aphelios R and now he doesnt even know how to spell his name.
2386,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e15,"> lose fights/cooldowns because aphelious ult does something those players don't expect.

Can you clarify?

I assume you have pro view? Can you add the screenshot of the player writing ""wtf, I didn't expect your ult to do that"" to your post? Thank you."
2387,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e19,"Just permaban him, you don’t need clarity when you can’t play against him"
2388,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e1d,Get better then silver
2389,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e21,"Youre talking about a minor league, what tf is that kinda argument lol"
2390,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e25,I think you have to learn how to spell the champ's name before you complain about his lack of clarity.
2391,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e29,Or you could read what it does lmao
2392,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e2d,"what do you mean you cant tell what his R is about to do? you can see his secondary weapon on the back quite damn clearly, he most of the time will be switching weapons to make it even easier, his ultimate color is different depending on  type, and most of the time only purple means you are fucked, at max distance a champion with no boots can sidestep that sht, only thing which is hard for non aphelios player is to remember all his combos and how he can execute them"
2393,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e31,"[Here](https://youtu.be/3AIq_b4HDk4?t=1868) is a very good proof that having his off-hand as a clear thing isn't even needed, it should have been mandatory when the champ was released.  
(for people not getting it, Aphelios had his Calibrum hand so DL wasn't affraid of him but Johnsun suddenly changed to his off-hand Gravitum which makes it so that his ult roots. So he ults immediatelly after the switch and DL dies)"
2394,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e35,"Also the main reason he is perma-ban in addition to having too much power previously (and maybe now I dunno). You can't tell what his kit is, so if you don't want to play him you have to ban him. If he were totally even in balance with every other ADC he'd almost never see pro play because why bother with the extra trouble other than the lack of clarity deceiving the other team, but he'd still be banned because you can't risk the lack of clarity.

He's by far the worst designed (of those that were actually still functional) champion ever released. Complexity with no actual skill expression (aka just plain unintuitive), crap clarity, and has to be overtuned to see any use because of it.

Sett with his ""simple"" kit with oodles of skill expression and pretty much just numbers that might be iffy is so much better designed it's embarrassing."
2395,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e39,"True. But we are also talking about his ult.  It looks the same no matter weapons and you kind of only just know what happened after you are hit..  sure you might know if you are close to him, but the ability has so much range and looks so similar that it is really confusing."
2396,5e385ab6841d20c9f2617e3d,"yeah definetly this, and maybe make ult more distinguishable from each other, you cant always be looking at him and he can Switch weapon right before ulting so you cant alway be ready and know what he'll do. He's really strong honestly, he does a bit of everything... and a lot of dmge"
2397,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e41,"I was also wondering one more thing - While it is logical.. should he be able to switch his weapons that fast.. and well, ult with it?  
  
You might also be low on ammo on one weapon, so you could technically keep 3 types of ult at ready"
2398,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e45,"You know what the worst part is? That it isn't even  not knowing the offhand weapon that bad, it is that you don't know what weapon is coming up unless you know what the last weapon he got was. So he could have Severum with limited ammo, infernum in his offhand, use severum Q, and get crescendum (i think that is the order) and then start wailing on your with that immediately after the Severum Q."
2399,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e49,not to mention that one of his auto attacks looks like varus ult so i'm tryna flash away from fucking auto attacks.
2400,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e4d,Plus that champion has wayyy too many things going on. A fucking turret? Seriously?
2401,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e51,We need a complete rework. Still blows my mind that a champion like that made it to the live servers.
2402,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e55,Yeah no idea why offhand isn't shown since it's used on his q's...
2403,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e59,Paying attention to what is happening IS a skill tho.
2404,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e5d,/u/playtestpenguin
2405,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e61,Once that fucker had his lifesteal offhand unbeknowst to me so instead of killing him quickly he just facetanked me and killed me.
2406,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e65,hi jacking top comment to ask : why isnt this bs champ perma banned ? same for sett ?
2407,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e69,"People keep wanting offhand next to him but when guns go away or switch it won't really help. It's such a small change especially in team fights.

Wouldn't it be better to work like udyr bear stance? Where he gets a quick shiny icon when he swot he's guns. Everyone would instantly know he switched guns and what gun he now has. It would be so much better for clarity than the tiny icon people want which I honestly don't think will help much"
2408,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e6d,Also make his flamethrower lightblue instead of darkblue. Right now purple and blue look very similar imo
2409,5e385ab7841d20c9f2617e71,"Remember when Lancer Blitzcrank had to keep the waddling walking animation because of clarity?

Then you have a champion that you can't tell what will he do in the middle of a fight nor what will his Ult do."
2410,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617e75,aphelios and that soraka skin that looks like a new champ need updating
2411,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617e79,*cries in purple Zac on old purple rift*
2412,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617e7d,"I know this thread is about aphelios but while we bitching about riots direction. Why they say old nidalee spears were broken, THEN THEY RELEASE ZOE WHICH IS THE SAME FUCKING THING I WANT TO PLAY NIDALEE AGAIN FUCK ME. 
 Thanks for listening to my TED talk."
2413,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617e81,The champ is a giant Fuck You to every OG player who just wants strategy back in the game not flash champions with overdone kits
2414,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617e85,Well in all fairness to the skin point that's different because then it's pay to win rather than just pick to win
2415,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617e89,I kind of want them to ban this champ from competitive play. It is too complicated.
2416,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617e8d,I wish there was a version of the game that appeared without any skins to my screen.
2417,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617e91,yeah give us 8-bittlesticks
2418,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617e95,Yet odyssey yasuo is a thing.
2419,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617e99,"yesterday i was i jumped into a game with a friend and went to toilet in the loading screen. i came back, bought items and went toplane while chatting with my buddy. I was just autopiloting toplane which is quite easy as malphite. I didnt really paid attention and at some point the enemy jax activated his E and jumped on me.

I was super confused what just happened and had to tab to see who my enemy is. I play this game for 10 years and know jax in and out but i could not recognize this champ based on the skin he was running. 

It was also confusing because i was firstpick and never expect anyone to be dumb enough to pick a jax into a malphite.

point is, some skins are just dumb"
2420,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617e9d,Same with most skins released the last 8 months. SUPER difficult to tell who the champ is since they change the sillouette so much.
2421,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617ea1,"That ""visual clarity"" guideline for skins went out of the window a long time ago. The effects of a lot of skins nowadays are so different that I have no idea what champion throws them until I have seen them two times. They look SO different."
2422,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617ea5,"> every custom skin that got denied because it would ""negatively impact game clarity""

That was years ago and is long gone... I remember playing against Ekko/Senna/Lucian the other day with their newest and fanciest skins (True Damage and idk the others, I don't buy or pay attention to skins) and I legit couldn't tell whose ability's were whose because the particles were so simiilar between them and different from the classic skins"

2424,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617ead,"Tbh, they have been giving many fuck yous to game clarity for a while now.

I played A TON of ranked from 2012-2016 and I like to think I have a solid history with the game. Even then, when I log in nowadays, its not rare for me to not recognize some newer skin from looking at it in the game.

For example, a lot of the male juggernauts look like each other (its a bulky man with a thematic suit) and some characters are a just too different from their original looks (which is something that wasnt ok back then)

It does seem like the company valued game clarity a lot more back then."
2425,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617eb1,No custom skin asking actually got denied because of clarity. They were actually denied because they do not want people modding their game.
2426,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617eb5,This game has been team deathmatch since season 8
2427,5e385ab8841d20c9f2617eb9,/u/playtestpenguin
2428,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ebd,For some reason I haven't played vs. Aphelios a single time. Not many people play him in ranked.
2429,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ec1,It is almost like certainlyT shouldnt design champions.
2430,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ec5,"This, Zoe, and Yuumi are the biggest champ design mistakes Riot has made in the last couple years which have already been riddled with some of the worst most overloaded champ design in history (reworks included)"
2431,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ec9,"I took one look at his kit, realized it was some broken ass shit and that the indicators were crap, and banned him every single game. Looks like I was right considering the fact that Avocados now has a higher ban rate than Yasuo in platinum+ soloqueue and a 100% pick/ban presence in professional play.

But hey, better nerf Soraka."
2432,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ecd,To be fair it happened pretty fast and he probably just had to focus on something else. The fight at T2 bot tower was a cluster fuck.
2433,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ed1,Kobe was already dead prior due to the Corki.
2434,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ed5,kobbe was 60% hp and the ult dmg + spread dmg from 3 targets killed him. if 1 was hit by infernum he lives by 20-30% hp.
2435,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ed9,Eh that was a 4 man infernum ult in a choke point after getting hit by two aatrox q’s and being at 60% health.
2436,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617edd,Kobe actually got 1 shot a week ago...
2437,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ee1,Kobbe had 50% health but whatever keeps the circlejerk going huh
2438,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ee5,"That is the problem to me: I tried him in practice tool, I tried him against bots, I even tried him in a normal game. I understand how he works and have at least some understanding what is dangerous and what is not.

But since he is not readable at all at a glance, I have no fucking clue whats happening when I play against him. Sure if I would see a replay I could explain it, but I bet you most of the time I'd probably not play it different, because I just don't understand in the moment.

The champ has way too much stuff. Reduce the amount of weapons the 3 most interesting (whatever that is), bind them to Q,W,E. Let yourself choose which weapon you get, second press of your weapon button lets you use its current Q ability. After ammo runs out you get to use one of the other weapons with your first weapon becoming offhand."
2439,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ee9,Idk what that champ does. All I need to know is that he has no mobility so I can fuck him up early with reksai hoohohohihohh
2440,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617eed,You need to throw cleaver at him
2441,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ef1,"You should try him btw, once you play him for a few games you'll understand what he can do, and how to predict that. He's too strong right now, but after a few nerfs / something to show his off-hand weapon he should be fine."
2442,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ef5,In the early game it's actually not that hard. It's sniper>heal into slow>flamethrower>turret. After that it's harder to keep track of. But at least in laning phase he can be played against and predict what he does
2443,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617ef9,Once they stop making sales on his skins and the champion with RP he'll be nerfed. Ekko was made busted leading up to true damage and every new champ is absolutely broken as hell. Fuck ranked until this shits sorted
2444,5e385ab9841d20c9f2617efd,they should've stopped the guy who was trying to give him 5 guns. just give him 2-3 instead.
2445,5e385aba841d20c9f2617f01,"They will eventually nerf him out of relevance. But they can't do that when he's still too new, because they frankly just need the sales. Each champion release requires a lot of financial investment from Riot, so they need to recoup that investment through sales of that champion.

Once enough time has passed, they'll gut this champion. I promise you that. He cannot be balanced. It's a fundamental issue with this champion's design that he will be very annoying to play against. Even if they were to make his ult more visible, that would only solve one out of the many issues this champion faces. Many of the problems cannot be easily corrected... they'd need to essentially rework him which they won't do anytime soon due to how expensive it is to do that.

Give it maybe 2 months and I promise you he gets nerfed incredibly hard and never sees play again."
2446,5e385aba841d20c9f2617f05,Whenever I see Aphelious I just back off lmao champ pressure X factor
2447,5e385aba841d20c9f2617f09,"They won't nerf him, they'll milk all of the skin sales possible out of him for the next few years.."
2448,5e385aba841d20c9f2617f0d,"
>I just accept that sometimes aphelious kills me and I have no idea why.


That sums up my experience. The only chance to understand this champ is to play him, but I need to buy him first which will nof happen. Now i always ban him"

2456,5e385aba841d20c9f2617f2d,I don't get why Aphelios has half the shit he does. Why does he just get free %armor penetration too? Where the fuck does that even make sense on him? It isn't even tied to an ability. He just gets it for no reason.
2457,5e385aba841d20c9f2617f31,At least now RioT can figure out that global auto attacks dont work. Because it is such a surprise
2458,5e385aba841d20c9f2617f35,"I feel like Riot needs to be more willing to do this, especially with new champs"
2459,5e385aba841d20c9f2617f39,100% support for this
2460,5e385aba841d20c9f2617f3d,"Or at least have a few months' grace period before any new character is legal for pro games. Dota usually waits 2-4 months before adding new heroes to captain's mode (the game mode that pro games are played on), but league throws them in there right away, it's stupid"
2461,5e385aba841d20c9f2617f41,"I feel like he’s a champion similar to Sylas who should be kept undertuned, if not for the same reasons. Sylas should not be a blindpick hero, but one you use into specific enemy comps. If he can be picked into any situation, he’s definitely overtuned. Conversely, Aphelios should be undertuned and require OTP, high-IQ play and ammo management to unlock his kit to a competitive level. Right now, he’s braindead to play as and incredibly difficult to play against.

This may not be a popular opinion, but I feel his champion design would’ve been much better with 3 guns instead of 5. Let’s be real, it’s a travesty that Crescendum is not a champion of its own, and Infernum is a balance nightmare and a thematically awful “flamethrower.” Even then, 3 “transformations” would’ve been a unique mechanic for LoL."
2462,5e385abb841d20c9f2617f45,Qiyana in current form is a mistake as well. An assassin should never have a stun.

but the champion is assfuck cancer though. wish they would have implemented this way better"
2469,5e385abb841d20c9f2617f61,Its not just his ult though. His whole kit is easy to not realize whats coming up.
2470,5e385abb841d20c9f2617f65,">It doesn't fit a marksman

What the fuck does this even mean

Stop spewing bullshit, we get it that you're just super mad but try to write something coherent"
2471,5e385abb841d20c9f2617f69," In case of rework here is an interesting option:

Alune can be launched as an ADC along with Aphelios, give each of them 2 of the guns, maybe a 3rd in common.

This way it would be less convoluted and still be interesting. They could be a duo bot like Rakan & Xayah, Lucian & Senna being Alune & Aphelios.

Don't even need to change the VO all that much if at all, just let them keep a mental connection with Alune being chatty. Hah!

And just get rid of the current ultimate, in favor of a more static but  more unique one, instead of big ball of damage. Even if it still applies  the weapon effects, having a less weapons would make it more  predictable.

Getting rid of the ammo mechanic would not be a big loss either in case of each kit having  only 2 weapons.  Could even give each of them an E skill, and complementing new Rs.

Maybe one supportive weapon and another offensive to have both be Support ADC, a different combination, or have Alune be support like she already is but be in-game fighting alongside each other!"
2472,5e385abb841d20c9f2617f6d,"this same shit happened with Akali, i dont know why people are suprised at this point"
2473,5e385abb841d20c9f2617f71,"They know exactly what they’re doing, they just don’t care.  They fact that they keep repeating the same “mistakes” over and over again with their champion design & balance patches throughout the years is proof that they don’t care.

Their main priority is selling a new champ that everyone will play and perhaps buy a skin for within the coming several months. And maybe get the impulsive players to buy the champ with actual RP if they didn’t have have enough blue essence saved up to get it for free."
2474,5e385abb841d20c9f2617f75,"Riot is just releasing more and more bullshit op champs because they probably think this game is peaked and want to sell RP. Because with only 6 bans and dozens of broken af new champs, you will have to own them or lose to them eventually. Then when the game slowly dies out similar to WoW, they will have all their other games they are working on to keep making them money. This is just my theory."
2475,5e385abb841d20c9f2617f79,"just stop letting certainlyT do whatever the fuck he likes, we get that he's a psychopath who didn't get any attention as a child but why do millions of league players have to suffer for it?"

2478,5e385abb841d20c9f2617f85,"I've felt this way about League since they released Jayce and Zyra in the same month. I quit the game for a full year after that. The state those 2 champions were in at launch is easily akin to rework Akali and Irelia. 


Only back then the game was still relatively young so you could make the argument they didn't expect the outcome. To have the sheer amount of just straight up terribly designed champs in the game right now is a testament to how awful the balance and design teams are."
2479,5e385abc841d20c9f2617f89,I always like to think that Riot doesn't have a QA team with the amount of consistent problems in the game.
2480,5e385abc841d20c9f2617f8d,"You're going way overboard. They are pushing the limits and yes it puts us out of our comfort zone but the idea behind Aphelios and what they were trying to achieve with him is pretty cool.  

I don't think his kit is problematic, I think it's more about visual clarity of what he's doing. They could show main / off hand at all times and have clearer animations for his ult depending on the main weapon he has when he uses it. They could clean up the visuals of his turret to make it look more threatening and give it a fixed hp count like wards or something so people aren't caught off guard by how tanky it is.   


They could give his weapon switch (when he depletes a weapon) a longer downtime so he can't abuse multiple Qs from different weapons in a short time where people can't undestand what's happening."
2481,5e385abc841d20c9f2617f91,"Have you ever had, like, a real, adult job? Because you seem pretty clueless about how things work in the real world."

No reason why we can't have all 5 weapons listed, and then highlighted based on which guns are on off/main hand"
2483,5e385abc841d20c9f2617f99,"> For example, the turret could have an icon of what gun it's using to fire.

Didn't they try to give clarity with this by making the turret which gun its using, just smaller?"
2484,5e385abc841d20c9f2617f9d,At least two clear markers next to him to show which guns are being utilized along with his ult projectile having the marker to show what effect it will have
2485,5e385abc841d20c9f2617fa1,How can you say that when they literally just released Sett? I honestly believe that they’re trying to release both complicated and simple champs which is fair
2486,5e385abc841d20c9f2617fa5,"
Sett is simple."
2487,5e385abc841d20c9f2617fa9,"This. Think about the last 4 character releases. The only one that is even a little simple is Sett, and as far as bruisers go, it still has a few complexities.

But Aphelios? 5 guns, 20 combination-effects. Mark this, tons of damage that, stunned there, slowed there, shot from 1000 meters, Ult that one shots, Ult that slows. No visibility on secondary gun, the list goes on.

Senna? Infinite stacking Passive, huge range-aoe healing damage poke, AoE invisibility for allies that also gives movement speed, builds assassin, has a long range huge hitbox control-activation Root that also slows you on hit, global ult that shields in a wide area, and damages in a thin one. Support, btw.

Qiyana? Low cooldowns, spammable gapclose/dodge, 9 different ability effects, engage that makes her main damaging ability literally undodgeable, high AD ratios, high scalings, an Ult that knocks you back, and then stuns you along the whole wall, meaning she could totally miss it and most people will still end up dead by it. Don't forget spammable Chain stun/invis with ELEMENTS.

Like give us a fucking break. Not every champion needs to have insane versatility, high AoE, tons of damage and 30 different mechanics. In fact, Balance literally says do the opposite. Give characters real weak points other than 'Don't be bad.' These last few characters have been so disheartening for playing against."
2488,5e385abc841d20c9f2617fad,"Remember when Lee Sin was the ""complicated"" champ? Yeesh."
2489,5e385abc841d20c9f2617fb1,"TECHNICALITY ALERT

Aatrox was technically removed from the game for a while, and was re added in a different state later.  This has realistically nothing to do with the actual point of your post, but hey."
2490,5e385abc841d20c9f2617fb5,Love how often you guys say this when a strong champ is released. Same thing with Yasuo on his release as well. Zoe too.

2492,5e385abc841d20c9f2617fbd,"I don’t think it’s the cluster. Seems obvious that in a game as frantic as league, animations for difference should be different. Aphelion ult can do several different things - but has the exact same animation for all of them. That’s not  just player skill, it’s just bad game design (visually)."
2493,5e385abc841d20c9f2617fc1,"And has caused more people to play and main his champions than any other designer, even when his champs aren't in-meta."
2494,5e385abc841d20c9f2617fc5,"Wait, the ult has different colours?"
2495,5e385abc841d20c9f2617fc9,"Only ones you can tell at a glance are the red and purple ones. The other 3 are almost indistinguishable, specially in the one second you need to react. Also the hitbox is huge, hard to avoid in a choke point or teamfight, and the skill is very forgiving as an indirect hit is all it takes."
2496,5e385abd841d20c9f2617fcd,"Or you know, Colorblind people exist. Having color be the only way to visually distinguish between things is a Godawful design choice."
2497,5e385abd841d20c9f2617fd1,"So you're telling me that the casters also are unsure what is happening with his ulti in the moment. Can't imagine the stress of playing against it in an actual LCS game where performance in it is your job. You need insane reaction and all off of a champion you don't play unless you're the 1 of 5 that plays ADC.

As an AD player who hasn't touched him yet I would say I don't even know the names of the guns and that the names aren't overly intuitive."
2498,5e385abd841d20c9f2617fd5,"Considering how few people even realized this, I think that just speaks to how the clarity is still lacking. Put the weapon mark on the ult, or change its shape (like, circular for chakram, maybe looks more elongated for calibrum. It'd look cleaner if they could make this work but it'd also be the hardest to keep the hitboxes making sense). 

&#x200B;

And then if someone's colorblind (even partially) it just makes it properly indistinguishable."
2499,5e385abd841d20c9f2617fd9,"i dunno man, its REALLY hard to tell between the blue ult with puprle outline, blue ult with blue outline and blue ult with whitishblue outline

2500,5e385abd841d20c9f2617fdd,The ult moves way too fast and has way to much white For the color to be able to help you decide how to react to it. They need to be WAY more different

I know his flamethrower ult does like aoe damage or some shit and his gravit-whatever roots people? Or puts a mark on them that gives a root? Honestly don’t know. Don’t care to learn, either. I just won’t ever play vs him."
2503,5e385abd841d20c9f2617fe9,"Meanwhile, let me describe some more typical champions.

* Sivir

 * Her Q is a skillshot boomerang. Her W makes her attacks ricochete. Her E is a spellshield. Her ult is an AoE run fast buff.

* Kog'Maw

 * Q is skillshot that lowers armor. W increases range and makes him do %hp on hit. E is skillshot that leaves ooze that slows enemies. R is an long range artillery shot.

* Tristana

 * Q is attack speed. W is jump, slows enemies it lands on. E is a bomb that charges up with attacks, and also passively makes enemies AoE on death. R is a knockback.

* Nasus

 * His Q gets +3 bonus damage for every minion he's killed with it. His W is a a slow. His E does a ground AoE. His ult gives him HP.

* *Aphelios*

 * I'm going to need about 30 minutes of your time..."

But Aphelios is not that far behind"

2508,5e385abd841d20c9f2617ffd,"yeah riven is selling skins and she is given unfair advantages which made her to never fell out of meta for her entire existence, but she has clarity in a sense that after couple of games against a gold+ riven main, you know that if you misstep she is going to 100-0 you during a perma stun. Fair or not, its clear what she is doing, while this thread is about a champion against even pro gamers have no idea what is going on"
2509,5e385abe841d20c9f2618001,"Apparently it does have different colors, but it’s hard to tell. Thought it was only white."
2510,5e385abe841d20c9f2618005,"I mean, you’re not wrong. It’s a skill shot that deals damage in AoE when it hits a champion; every champion hit by the AoE is then hit a second time based on the weapon: Rifle marks all targets, Pistol heals Aphelios, Cannon marks all targets, Flamethrower makes another, higher damage AoE explosion on all targets, and Chakram gives bonus chakrams to Aphelios based on the number of targets hit."
2511,5e385abe841d20c9f2618009,He has one hard CC. On his worst weapon.
2512,5e385abe841d20c9f261800d,he could easily be QWER but certainlyT had to be edgy and change the HUD just for one champ
2513,5e385abe841d20c9f2618011,If only riot made an client side default skins option
2514,5e385abe841d20c9f2618015,I think the problem is you on that one
2515,5e385abe841d20c9f2618019,I'm with you. Kaisa/Senna/Aphellios all look pretty much the same to me.
2516,5e385abe841d20c9f261801d,"League has ALWAYS had very easy to understand champs. They cast a spell, it does a thing, and there’s 4 of them per champ. Then you have Nid, Jayce, Elise, Kled, who have different skills based on their appearance. 

Now I have to learn 5 different shits for this one guy, all of which have another 5 different abilities, and can interact differently with his offhand gun in what seems like dozens of ways. However, all of this flows naturally for the aphelios player.

It’s unlike any other champ in that regard. This champ is just absurdly more complicated in terms of knowledge than anything ever before. I’m not saying it’s too much, I’m saying it breaks HEAVILY from Riot’s tradition of clarity."
2517,5e385abe841d20c9f2618021,There’s no other champ in the game I’d have to play myself to figure out. Any other champ if I lame against them once or twice then I understand them.
2518,5e385abe841d20c9f2618025,"I feel like I'm insane ""they died because they didnt know what he did!!!!!"" 

Do pro players not know what ori does when they get hit by a 4 man shockwave and die? No,  they just fucked up and misplayed"
2519,5e385abe841d20c9f2618029,"Wouldn't you still be surprised in most cases, though? At best you'd have a 1/5 (if I understood a previous comment correctly) chance in guessing what his ult is going to do. If you go all in on your guess and you're wrong, you'll quite possibly be in a much worse position, right?"
2520,5e385abe841d20c9f261802d,"You can see what changes when you level them up by hovering the + or the ability icon (not really sure which one)

and I don't quite get what you mean by ""see what the scaling are"""
2521,5e385abe841d20c9f2618031,Whatever gun is his primary at the time of using the ult also hits the enemy. Not too difficult to understand.
2522,5e385abe841d20c9f2618035,Still a shit champion with an overturned kit that has the same skill ceiling as master yi.
2523,5e385abe841d20c9f2618039,"I think there is an example of Johnsun killing Doublelift by ulting, cycling his gun to the root gun, and then rooting him. Dlift, despite his legacy of not using flash, probably would have used it if he had know the stun gun was coming. 

Not sure how he works either tbh."
2524,5e385abe841d20c9f261803d,"What skins make their champions unclear?
(Legit never had that problem; not denying that they exist)"
2525,5e385abe841d20c9f2618041,"Some of the skins, I actually need to think for a second to figure out who it is. There was an Udyr in my game but it was some chroma. Kept fking me forgetting it was Udyr."
2526,5e385abf841d20c9f2618045,Sivir is a dog champ because the community didn't like seeing her every other game in pro play and she was way stronger in soloQ than Aphelios.
2527,5e385abf841d20c9f2618049,"Serveraum’s Q is probably the strongest. It locks his autos, so try to use it as an advantage."
2528,5e385abf841d20c9f261804d,"Gravitum or ""purple goop"" doesn't stun btw"
2529,5e385abf841d20c9f2618051,"Purple is one of his worst combos.  


The combo you should fear is Crescendum (white) + Calibrum (green)."
2530,5e385abf841d20c9f2618055,the qtpie special
2531,5e385abf841d20c9f2618059,"Wow two whole times, that’s definitely enough to learn a champ"
2532,5e385abf841d20c9f261805d,why does udyr have like 4 different forms what the heck. ?
2533,5e385abf841d20c9f2618061,"... the whole point of the thread is that the best players in the world have the same exact problems. It’s a trash champion made by certain designers who warp the game EVERY single time they made a champion. 

Broken clocks and right time kind of situation. F this champion."
2534,5e385abf841d20c9f2618065,"It’s a mix of both. His ult has a different bonus effect for all weapons, but most of the time you can’t tell what his offhand is until he switches. So say a team fight is about to break out and Aphelios had Gravitum in main hand and Infernum in off hand. The enemy team likey won’t see he has Infernum and will engage pretty grouped up. An Infernum ult with everyone grouped will turn the fight in Aphelios’ teams favor most likey because of the 75% extra damage and Aoe splash."
2535,5e385abf841d20c9f2618069,CertainlyT and crew get off on breaking every boundary in the game.
2536,5e385abf841d20c9f261806d,"It’s different for each weapon. Long story short 1 marks champions, 1 slows, 1 give health, 1 does a bunch of Aoe damage, and one gives bonus mini weapons."
2537,5e385abf841d20c9f2618071,"They talked about clarity for a long time... But yes, they talk about shit they don't follow through on all the time.  Like how they had a big post explaining their criteria for nerfing champions and then follow those edicts at random."
2538,5e385abf841d20c9f2618075,Not gonna lie I played him the first time and I did shitty I'm used to being strategic with my skills as a Luci and Kai sa main in bot lane. I played him a second time and said fuck it I see people wrecking with him so I'm just gonna mash my keyboard with my forehead I hard carried the team and I didn't have a clue what I was doing.  There is no skill to this champ just mash buttons as soon as they come off cd
2539,5e385abf841d20c9f2618079,His ult is not point and click.
2540,5e385abf841d20c9f261807d,"The windup for Orianna's shockwave (ball going in + shockwave animation) gives plenty of time for players to GTFO and makes it super telegraphed. Actually being able to hide Ori's ball in a fight is part of mastering the champ, you want to people lose track of it *because if they know the ball is there it's super easy to avoid.*

But for Aphelios the windup is only the travel time of the projectile and the range is huge. It's way less telegraphed making hitting it much easier."
2541,5e385abf841d20c9f2618081,This is the dumbest comment I've seen in a while.
2542,5e385abf841d20c9f2618085,"And... we are back to a ton of invisible dmg.  Sure runnan is to blame too, but aphelios is hardly to blame too.  I dont wish for just removing this chaml, but it feels like not 1 single thought was put on clarity.  On probably the champion that NEEDS it the most...."
2543,5e385ac0841d20c9f2618089,...but...pyke exists...
2544,5e385ac0841d20c9f261808d,his weapon on the back is hard to tell when he isnt looking away from the camera and even harder if he ults you from fog of war
2545,5e385ac0841d20c9f2618091,No other champ do I have to examine their visual detail to understand how they function.
2546,5e385ac0841d20c9f2618095,"Adding a second icon next to his hp bar so both his weapons are clearly visible would solve A TON of visual issues. Although I think Riot did a pretty good job overall making each gun's animation and silhouette unique, it is still very hard to tell which gun is on his back at a glance (especially severum and crescendum because they are so small), which you see in this clip."
2547,5e385ac0841d20c9f2618099,literally switches and ults so fast you can't tell. that's stupid
2548,5e385ac0841d20c9f261809d,"The worst part about it is that if Aphelios has one of the smaller weapons being off-handed and hes facing  a particular way, you legitimately cannot see it, meaning you don't know what his capabilities are at all. You can literally get entirely screwed out of a game just because of which side of the map Aphelios is on, and where he's likely to face. I personally think it shouldn't be on his back, it should be in his other hand, hence the name ""off-hand""."
2549,5e385ac0841d20c9f26180a1,"What that doesn't disprove what he said at all.

If DL could have very clearly seen at a glance that Grav was in the OH then he would ha e known to be more careful around the ult range.

In fact it's a perfect example of how showing the OH clearly would have helped the situation be understood and read.

Edit: it appears my brain decided to completely skip the second half of your statement and we are in fact in agreement. My bad."
2550,5e385ac0841d20c9f26180a5,"> That was sweet!

No, it was not"
2551,5e385ac0841d20c9f26180a9,"If I'm watching this correctly, what actually happened was that Aphelios simply fired a Calibrum ult, and activated the mark for a Grav AA since it was in the OH. From there, switch and Grav Q for snare. Zero need to show the OH weapon, and zero clarity for opposing player."
2552,5e385ac0841d20c9f26180ad,Gravitum ult increases the passive slow by 99%.Using Q while it's on them activates the root
2553,5e385ac0841d20c9f26180b1,"OK then lets talk about how about half the champions in the game have skins that just make it nearly impossible to distinguish which ability they are using. Shit pool party Cait's trap is the same color as minions and is super hard to see in combat. There are plenty of clarity issues, it's not just aphelios."
2554,5e385ac0841d20c9f26180b5,I feel like DL should have expected Aphelios to have the root gun anyway.
2555,5e385ac0841d20c9f26180b9,"Wait, wait.

Why the actual fuck does the orb on Gravitum disappear when it's on his back?"
2556,5e385ac0841d20c9f26180bd,Flash flash flash flash flash
2557,5e385ac0841d20c9f26180c1,"Gravitum Ult wasn't even necessary (just adds a bigger slow) as Calibrum Ult would give a Mark.

Honestly, I'm in favor of more clarity, but I don't think this is *proof*. You can just respect his guns until you know for sure what Aphelios can do. That just seemed disrespectful to not flash before the ult hits when he wasn't sure what the off-hand was going to be."
2558,5e385ac0841d20c9f26180c5,I will say here that you can see Aphelios offhand in his passive bar. Just dicovered it the other day. It still needs clarity though but at least you cam click him and show it
2559,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180c9,[deleted]
2560,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180cd,My guy wrote a novel in parentheses.
2561,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180d1,"It's a certainlyT champ, what do you expect"
2562,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180d5,"Honestly, I ban Aphelios simply because 99% of the playerbase WILL NOT engage on him. He has zero escapes, he's like a Jinx, just jump on him and he explodes.

Also, you wanna know how to not care about his ult past the initial explosion? Blind him, or play Shen. Anything that would prevent him from autoing you will make his ult a waste.

I think a small indicator for the current two guns would be nice though, and just have it update when his guns swap.

TBH I still stand by my opinion that he isn't that terrible to deal with."
2563,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180d9,Could not fucking agree more.
2564,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180dd,i think if they just make the ult a diff color for each weapon and have a secondary weapon icon next to HP bar his visibility will be fine
2565,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180e1,I mean you should be able to know what the ult is going to do based on his weapon... but no apparently people being too lazy to learn a new champions kit just because they don’t play him is obviously just bad design.
2566,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180e5,"His ult in general needs to be better visible, it is such a faint effect that you barely notice it in a full on teamfight with a lot of shit flying around. It is way too impactful to ignore.

Also need the range or the AoE of it, it's just too much overall."
2567,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180e9,That won't always help because you can do stuff like flamethrower/sniper q into ult quite easily and if the gun swaps on the q there is almost 0 time to react.
2568,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180ed,That's literally the intended way for a good Aphelios player to utilize the ammo mechanic.
2569,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180f1,You can be low on ammo on 2 weapons and have 4 ults basically instantly ready
2570,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180f5,"But he didn't.

He hit with Calibrum ult, used the mark to land a Grav auto, then switched to Grav for the Q. Never had to show his offhand before the danger."
2571,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180f9,The order changes - depending on when they get used. It always starts off the same - but when a weapon runs out of ammo it is always put into the back of the line.
2572,5e385ac1841d20c9f26180fd,Calibrum / Severum > Graviton > Infernum > Crescendum is always the order before it loops back.
2573,5e385ac1841d20c9f2618101,Yeah imo just delete the Char and redo it
2574,5e385ac1841d20c9f2618105,Totally agree. I absolutely hate the champ.
2575,5e385ac1841d20c9f2618109,Lmao cmon thats quite the overreaction just some nerfs on the numbers is enough
2576,5e385ac2841d20c9f261810d,"Wait if we're talking about walking animations, I'm still waiting on them to do something about Zombie Brand. His walking animation sometimes looks exactly like the animation he makes when he's about to throw out a W"
2577,5e385ac2841d20c9f2618111,"honestly though comparing that situation to aphelios is kinda unfair, because the whole situation with lancer blitz and badlands rumble was bullshit in general, but especially blitz. They had the fuckin animations ready from an already existing blitz skin, I blitz, which hovers during his w, and piltover customs blitz having a driving animation that would've fit fine, they just chose not to for an arbitrary reason that came off as laziness when stuff like fuzz fizz can make it really difficult to immediately tell ""hey that's fizz"""
2578,5e385ac2841d20c9f2618115,"> Remember when Lancer Blitzcrank had to keep the waddling walking animation because of clarity?

And then they go and keep adding 5 star guardian skins each month that all look the same."
2579,5e385ac2841d20c9f2618119,"Funny that Battle Boss Blitz didn't have to keep the waddling walking animation for the same reason :)

And how many blue skillshots that look almost exactly the same are there? 27?"
2580,5e385ac2841d20c9f261811d,"There are also the skins that make champs look too similar. Like BA jayce looks so identical to academy darius, that new lee skin with purple chroma looks like shen etc."
2581,5e385ac2841d20c9f2618121,"And then you remember there are champs like vlad where not even the one playing him can notice if he ulted
Edit: on his most recent skins (dark waters and nightbringer"")"
2582,5e385ac2841d20c9f2618125,"Battle boss blitz doesnt waddle, no?"
2583,5e385ac2841d20c9f2618129,Ok but not every blitz skin even uses the waddle so they're not even consistent in that
2584,5e385ac2841d20c9f261812d,"Out of all skins in the game, I think Lancer Blitzcrank is the most busted. His Q is so different to normal Blitz' Q that it is so painful playing against him."
2585,5e385ac2841d20c9f2618131,Don’t forget True Damage Qiyana using different colors for her elements.
2586,5e385ac2841d20c9f2618135,TF's pick a card could be fired without any indicator and just proc based on RNG and it would still have better clarity than Aphelios
2587,5e385ac2841d20c9f2618139,Can't ever tell what champ True Damage Ekko is until I'm already stunned by his W
2588,5e385ac2841d20c9f261813d,new soraka skin looks kinda like irelia when i’m not paying attention with the floating shit

2592,5e385ac2841d20c9f261814d,I can never tell if it's an Aatrox or a Kayle for a lot of the skins
2593,5e385ac3841d20c9f2618151,RIP original Steel Legion Lux. Near invisible abilities was fun for a week or so.
2594,5e385ac3841d20c9f2618155,"Nidalee doesn't have fancy free true damage, hard reset, etc... In her kit like recent champs but she can still good and give ton of fun if you play her a lot.
It's a very polyvalent champ, but yes her poke is very situational now that her spears are one of the hardest skillshot to get hit by.."
2595,5e385ac3841d20c9f2618159,"I said the exact same thing when Zoe came out. I couldn't believe my eyes. And to add on top of that, she can just take any summoners/active, and she has nid spear range CC. Made no sense."
2596,5e385ac3841d20c9f261815d,"I literally have never played Zoe but I did play a lot of AP Nid before the rework. Comparing the two is laughable. Zoe is *way* more balanced and healthy for the game. I actually think it's cool that they put a long rang burst champ back into the game while making it balanced.

I also wanna play old Nid tho T.T"
2597,5e385ac3841d20c9f2618161,When you play vs akali with an almost 8 years old champ and it feels like you are playing versus a boss in bloodborne on speed x2
2598,5e385ac3841d20c9f2618165,Honestly I think the only reason a lot of us keep playing is that we are addicted. A lot of my friends just don't seem to have any fun with the game anymore and it causes big arguments.
2599,5e385ac3841d20c9f2618169,The reason is that everyvody hate his ass and he's 223% banned
2600,5e385ac3841d20c9f261816d,I don’t think you understand. I perma ban him every game now but before I did almost always he is banned (otherwise he is picked) it’s actually insane. His overall banrate is 223% or something crazy
2601,5e385ac3841d20c9f2618171,"Fortunately he doesn't anymore. 

Unfortunately he didn't quit champ design sooner."
2602,5e385ac3841d20c9f2618175,Kind of funny that prior to League he had 0 experience as a game designer.

2605,5e385ac3841d20c9f2618181,"The problem isn't particularly bad champions, his creations are arguably the most fun champs to play in the game, its just that it's not always fun to play against them, and aphelios is a prime example of it. Aphelios is extremely fun to play, I feel like a wizard swapping between weapons and working out the different combos, however if I ever fucking see him picked by the enemy team, I will immediately dodge because it's just not worth the hastle"
2606,5e385ac3841d20c9f2618185,"I don't think it has anything to do with him. Riot wants unusual, ""out of the box"", game-breaking champions with overloaded kits. He just do what Riot wants."
2607,5e385ac3841d20c9f2618189,Good thing most of the design wasn't him then

2620,5e385ac4841d20c9f26181bd,"very good idea, but id even say make the guns effects weaker but not bound to an ammo system and get rid with the off-hand fuckery. make ult a thing of its own and we gucci. now its a unique, cool and easy to understand champino"
2621,5e385ac4841d20c9f26181c1,"I posted the same thought elsewhere, but I agree with your 3 weapon idea. It would still be a unique number of “transformations“ for LoL with bonus ammo management, and you would feel the pinch of whichever gun you’re missing if each has a unique niche.

IMO they need to get rid of Infernum and Crescendum. Crescendum deserves its own champion, and Infernum is just a balance nightmare, especially the ult. More than that, their unique damage patterns make it unnecessarily complicated and nightmarish for opponents to play around. Calibrum for range/safety, Severum for healing/dueling and Gravitum for cc. Even if you can’t see his off-hand then, well there’s only 2 possibilities.

My idea: Q is his current Q, W is for gun swapping and E is his Crescendum Q (Sentry), which would deploy your third gun and indirectly allow you to have all 3 in play at once. Add a range limit to AAing marked targets and maybe make his ult consistent (not change effects based on main hand)... and bam, easier to balance champion."

I used to perma ban every new champ till the next one got released and keep it like that(don't care what teammates prepick). I'm certain I won't swap from Aphelios permaban because this champion is the definition of terrible game design and having an unfair advantage over your enemies at all times. 

Literally 0 fun to play against and I've played against a lot of shit in 10 years of playing. This champion will never be in my games regardless of his winrate. Just scratch the entire champion and give people a refund."
2627,5e385ac5841d20c9f26181d9,I tried him several times and I still can't adapt on the fly to ults because I can't tell which offhand he has.

2645,5e385ac6841d20c9f2618221,"You made a bunch of logical and sound points so first off thank you for raising these, since it all makes a lot of sense. The first part you said reminds me a lot of Sett as well, who is made to be anti bruiser and tank because of his ult, but is also very strong in that he can be picked into any comp. Thus making him very strong. 

Aphelios would work so much better if he had 3 guns. He has a massive aoe, a snare, insane healing, burst, and very long range, all split out between 5 guns that have *combinations* between all of these at once. 3 guns would restrict him more and actually need to pick a gun for a situation. 

So many people have said it but the point still stands that it seems like he was made way too quickly and didn’t have nearly enough time in development. In reality, this champ should take a long time to concoct with how crazy that kit is. It *could have* worked out, but they just wanted him to be there so he can get a skin that fits his schematic and event. 

He’s gonna be another champ in that abysmal state where he has to be very weak unless he’s a menace. Tbh it’s better that way to move him to that territory like Kalista, but it’s a shame it has to be that way."

2649,5e385ac6841d20c9f2618231,"Alune should have been launched as an ADC along with Aphelios, give each of them 2 of the guns, maybe a 3rd in common.

This way it would be less convoluted and still be interesting. They could be a duo bot like Rakan & Xayah, Lucian & Senna being Alune & Aphelios.

Don't even need to change the VO all that much if at all, just let them keep a mental connection with Alune being chatty. Hah!

And just get rid of the current ultimate, in favor of a more static but more unique one, instead of big ball of damage. Even if it still applies the weapon effects, having a less weapons would make it more predictable.

Getting rid of the ammo mechanic would not be a big loss either in case of each kit having only 2 weapons. Maybe one supportive and another offensive. Or have Alune be support like she already is, but be in-game fighting alongside each other!"

2682,5e385ac8841d20c9f26182b5,God help the colorblind.  I didnt know they even had colors.
2683,5e385ac8841d20c9f26182b9,"I can’t help but disagree with this. I’m not saying you’re wrong though. Go into the practice tool and use the ult a few times. Get used to what they look like. 

Dodging something in a choke point is not a valid argument. It’s near impossible to dodge any ult in a choke point (rumble ult for instance or miss fortune). 

His ult travels rather slowly and should be sidestepped if you’re not right on top of him. If you’re on top of him and he ults you’re going to take damage. 

If there’s anything that needs to be reworked it’s his turrets."
2684,5e385ac8841d20c9f26182bd,League does have a colourblind mode but idk how his ult looks in it
2685,5e385ac8841d20c9f26182c1,Interesting point. Hadn’t considered this. Not sure a fix for this problem other than shape changing for each gun.
2686,5e385ac8841d20c9f26182c5,as a colorblind dude I didn’t even realize that his ult has color until this thread. just my 2 cents but it’s fucked up that riot can have stuff like that be in their game.
2687,5e385ac8841d20c9f26182c9,"The ult only gives your primary weapon effect, there is no other outline. It’s one color."
2688,5e385ac8841d20c9f26182cd,Sounds like a solid strat. Valid reasoning. Take my upvote
2689,5e385ac8841d20c9f26182d1,This is the exact extent I know as well. Having watched the spotlight and pros at on stream with it. That's all I understand even from a viewing experience let alone playing against it.

2693,5e385ac9841d20c9f26182e1,"It’s better than reading the in game abilities. When I first started playing Aphelios, the descriptions weren’t helpful at all."

Though if you say the pro's or gold+ even understand riven but not aphelios then aphelios must be a bigger problem yes."
2697,5e385ac9841d20c9f26182f1,It also varies from being a single target root to working on every target hit. Quickly turns into his best for combos.
2698,5e385ac9841d20c9f26182f5,"If the weakest part of your kit is a point and click root, you are probably not balanced."
2699,5e385ac9841d20c9f26182f9,That’s one too many
2700,5e385ac9841d20c9f26182fd,"Lol that fuckin unclear HUD. Clicked my level up stat for a few games cause it looked different to normal abilities so didnt think hotkeys would work, I always get the Q and W icons mixed up, thinking I can Q and shit. God damn new champs."

2702,5e385ac9841d20c9f2618305,I think Kaisa/Senna/Aphellios all pretty much look the same. The same emo look in different colors.
2703,5e385ac9841d20c9f2618309,"I completely agree. It would make more sense if you were capable of learning how to play against a champ’s kit, even if it is overloaded, like Akali, Qiyana, and others. In that case, you are at least able to see and understand what they are doing. 

But with Aphelios, it’s physically straining and brutal to figure out what’s happening. You’re able to understand what each gun does and what they do, but since there’s so many combinations and there’s no figure to see what the offhand is, the only way to figure it out are with colors. That’s not healthy in the slightest. 

On top of this, each gun is very overloaded and has crazy mechanics unlike any other in the game. There’s no downside for having whichever gun in a fight.  I appreciate the effort to make a “unique” champion, but it’s simply not good for the game with the state he’s in right now. 

So yes, it’s a pain in the ass to hear people complain about someone’s kit but when everyone in the game, including pro players are raising the same issues, it shows how many latent problems there are."
2704,5e385ac9841d20c9f261830d,That’s fair. If Riot does want to expand into more complex kits however they have to start somewhere. It’s not like a kit with this kind of variation is unheard of in mobas. Dota2 has had Invoker and brewmaster for a while
2705,5e385ac9841d20c9f2618311,"He's really not hard. Like at all. Literally he just has 5 abilities, play him one time and you'll get what he does."
2706,5e385ac9841d20c9f2618315,"Then dont play as him, literally just read his abilities. Or do you not do that either?"
2707,5e385ac9841d20c9f2618319,"I don't know if you care but in dota when you hover a skill you can see the dmg scaling at every lvl, mana cost, cooldowns... Everything is right there in a clear and concise manner. Anything and everything that changes at any lvl of the skill is shown in one box."
2708,5e385ac9841d20c9f261831d,"Yeah it’s just awkward that you can’t always see that info 

And by scaling I mean like what percentage of your Ap, Ad, Health, is convert into your abilities  for example ekkos q does damage plus 30% of his Ap  vs his ult does damage plus 150% of his Ap while I can google and find out that info is not easily found in game"

Edit: I can at least figure out what most champs do after pressing QWER once or twice..."
2713,5e385aca841d20c9f2618331,"but weapons tho... like he has range, close combat, and mage-like abilities."
2714,5e385aca841d20c9f2618335,"You should never stack up when he has ult, tho, since it will always benefit from hitting multiple targets. But they should add two more icons, to see his offhand and the next weapon in queue."
2715,5e385aca841d20c9f2618339,"What is a weapon, like shop items?"
2716,5e385aca841d20c9f261833d,One of the reasons (every one they gave was either wrong at the time or they’d go back on later) for reworking karma was her allies would have to know what her w did for it to be effective but then they released thresh with his w that’s also useless if your team doesn’t know what it does
2717,5e385aca841d20c9f2618341,"""Pro players don't know what they are doing"" bruh"
2718,5e385aca841d20c9f2618345,"Give him the Annie treatment. Give each gun a symbol and make three of them float over his head at all times. Main, off, and next."
2719,5e385aca841d20c9f2618349,I think my number one problem is that because he can run the guns out on his terms you can't internalize what he has. You get to late game all the sudden he pulling the pistol with the Chakrams to swap into chakram sniper to get retreating foes.  I don't want that mechanic to go away but since the clarity is so bad on him you can't even use game knowledge to make up the difference.  There are some other champs especially with some of the more expensive skins that mess with your ability to glance at them.  Its just Aphelios got the double whammy of being a dude and being able to hot swap his guns/gun order.
2720,5e385aca841d20c9f261834d,"I don't get why Riot did this for his main weapon, which is easy to see anyway but not for the secondary which is so damn hard to see."
2721,5e385aca841d20c9f2618351,Yeah this shit really isn't complicated. I don't know what is wrong with popular game companies the last couple years but everyone seems to be shitting the bed on executing the *simplest* of things.
2722,5e385aca841d20c9f2618355,"Although as he gets new skins, it’s going to be kind of annoying “relearning” which gun is which. And imagine, a couple years from now, when a new player joins and has to learn which gun is which con Aphelios in his base skin and the 6 other skins he’ll probably have by then.
Hell, sometimes I still get confused on which form is which with Kayns on-release skin..."
2723,5e385aca841d20c9f2618359,"No need for that shit, each Ult has a color. it would be resolved instantly...."
2724,5e385aca841d20c9f261835d,">(especially severum and crescendum because they are so small), which you see in this clip.

Didn't he have Calibrum and Gravitum? Am I misunderstanding something?"
2725,5e385aca841d20c9f2618361,"They need to make his UI not bright so I can actually play him. I'd like him if I could read his basics. 

I've got sensory processing issues, I physically can't make myself look at his UI because of the colors."
2726,5e385aca841d20c9f2618365,Even just the offhand by some ble we don'tneed to see what weapon he is using its obvious by animation and looking at it.
2727,5e385aca841d20c9f2618369,"Just remove this broken mess of a champ

I remember when people called champs like Jayce overloaded"

2729,5e385acb841d20c9f2618371,Maybe they should give him a short cooldown (like 1-2 sec) on being able to use R immediately after swapping weapons. Then he actually has to plan ahead a little.

2737,5e385acb841d20c9f2618391,What is so complicated about his kit? He does damage. Sometimes that damage can cc. Sometimes it can come from longer range. Sometimes it can heal. Sometimes it is aoe. He is a hyperscaling ADC with no mobility. Land cc and he is dead.
2738,5e385acb841d20c9f2618395,"Also there's a chance the idea isn't even completely CertainlyTs since a while back a Make-A-Wish kid made a champ concept (with help) for a space bounter hunter ADC with an overheat mechanic and multiple weapons. They didn't release it because the overheat mechanic didn't work well on an ADC.

Meanwhile this champ is an ADC that has to cycle guns to recharge (similar), has multiple weapons, and is basically K-Pop Master Chief (a space marine raised from boyhood to be a soldier with a female companion in his head that does a lot of the talking for him).

Hmmmmm."

2. His every ability is a goddamn paragraph, besides W. Unlike other champions, he has 5 passives, an ammo system, a different leveling method, 5 active abilities and an ult that changes its form. It's incredibly confusing. 
3. Just the fact that they had to give him a separate UI should be enough proof that his kit differs way too much from other champions. It's very confusing and on top of it it's not clear enough for anyone but the Aphelios player."

Out of the *entire cast* he's **by far** the most confusing champion to play against. You have absolutely no idea what he's going to do next. Will he one shot your whole team? Will he root you? Will he snipe you from global range? Tune in next time to Aphelios is bullshit.

Even if you managed to get onto her (which was hard, since she had a dash on a 3 second CD), she had a heal and a dash that could go over walls. Really, all you needed for a ""poke comp"" was Nidalee and then a 4-man hard engage squad. You'd just chuck spears on CD, heal any damage your team took, and eventually you'd land a spear on a squishy and they'd either have to give up the objective or try and fight at a disadvantage.

Granted, Zoe has much the same problems, with her only downside being no innate mobility - which is offset by being able to steal Flash from enemies."

Not only is his kit overloaded, but also he gets to CHOOSE if he wants to go TANK or FULL AP????


See, I can also describe champions.

Multiple weapons character, pressing Q swaps between a large aoe but slow-firing weapon and a fast-firing single target low damage weapon.

To add to my 3 guns point, I feel like one of his most important mechanics, ammo management, is a sham because so many of his guns are interchangeable. Calibrum/Infernum/Crescendum all have the same agenda (DPS) simply with different trading patterns. To have truly made ammo management important, Aphelios needs to feel the pinch of not having a gun available, and that can only happen if each gun is a truly unique niche.

2829,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618501,Ekko isn’t exactly the golden staple of assassin balance...
2830,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618505,Ekko has always and will always be a shitshow
2831,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618509,Rengar has a snare. You can still cast spells or Zhonyas to react.
2832,5e385ad1841d20c9f261850d,pyke is another xd champ
2833,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618511,"Champions like that really do not have to exist. Really,really do not have to."
2834,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618515,Except that version of rengar was insanely strong lol.
2835,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618519,"The reworked Rengar was VERY strong, in some cases even better than the old/now current Rengar. He wasn't reverted because he sucked, it was because Rengar mains overwhelmingly preferred original Rengar. I was very surprised when they chose to revert since I had already become so used to the rework."
2836,5e385ad1841d20c9f261851d,"Akali is one of the worst designs in the entire game, and is a complete abomination that cares so little for interactive and fair gameplay that its astounding she made it past playtesting. and this is AFTER shes had several mechanics ripped away from her. Its so gross thinking she used to have a heal on Q and could just sit under your tower for free.

at least Kalista and Zoe had the decency to fucking die when they got nerfed over and over."
2837,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618521,"They could literally turn her into a minion and she'd still he getting banned.

Almost as if pros don't actually react to nerfs or buffs."
2838,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618525,"CertainlyT should be relegated to single player games; he makes fun mechanics, but they absolutely don't work in multiplayer environments"
2839,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618529,"i think ww is one of the best reworks in the game, caitlyn too. i think he makes brillant champions if they don't have 38 mechanics per ability"
2840,5e385ad1841d20c9f261852d,"aphelios may be the most egregiously abusive champion right now, but lets not forget the other completely baffling releases in recent memory that would not have ever made it to the live version of the game if CT had anything less than free reign on his work"
2841,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618531,"Agreed certainly t makes champs that have a huge playerbase, yasuo and thresh are both massively played and the rest are also for the most part popular."
2842,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618535,"Bullshit :/

I really doubt anyone who runs their own company would have the mentality of ""They made a character I dislike, FIRE THEM!!!!"""
2843,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618539,Lmao get outta here
2844,5e385ad1841d20c9f261853d,Urgot was overtuned on 2018 worlds patch but wasn’t overly problematic to deal with and he’s sitting at a balanced state now
2845,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618541,What's your beef with Morde?
2846,5e385ad1841d20c9f2618545,Aatrox was removed until he was re-introduced after being reworked.
2847,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618549,"Skill shots, snare, life steal, slow, zone control with turrets, speed buff, Aoe, damage buff on auto's, long range ult that may or may not stun you or one shot you but it's ok he has no dash."
2848,5e385ad2841d20c9f261854d,">This champion is different?

Is it? Because I've heard ""that's it Riot just needs to remove this now"" for a quarter of the fucking roster at this point."
2849,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618551,Amen. Just silliness. All my elo comrades want to play and flip a coin to see if they can popoff mostly its just the sucking though.
2850,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618555,I do.
2851,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618559,"It's not that bad. There's a soraka skin though where her e literally blends in with the ground for me.  I think it's the priest one?

Green-yellow colorblind for me."
2852,5e385ad2841d20c9f261855d,"Not even kidding, I’ve messed around in practice tool trying to figure out how the hell he works and I’ve never noticed the coloring. Love my red-green colorblindness, normally not something that affects my games but the subtle coloring is pretty much incomprehensible for me."
2853,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618561,You shouldnt have to do all this. If you could have been fine with just making the colors more vibrant. Or more variery in its visual effects....
2854,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618565,I can't because Riot doesn't allow me to play a champ I don't own
2855,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618569,I mean they could just make the colours more vibrant...
2856,5e385ad2841d20c9f261856d,"Difficult to see in general. It’s more that the color
changes can make seeing on certain terrain more difficult. 

This isn’t a problem for other champs, there’s just too many colors to really be considerate of all terrains and types of color blindness."
2857,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618571,Doesn’t change the coloring or clarity much. It’s still incomprehensible for me.
2858,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618575,I'm not colorblind and it's still pretty hard to tell the difference. Yeah they change color but I don't think that it's enough of a difference.
2859,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618579,I’m not colorblind and I can’t tell the difference at all. It needs to be much more drastic.
2860,5e385ad2841d20c9f261857d,It's a bit ignorant yes but If you have to specifically play the champion yourself to know what he does then it sucks. If I'm not an ADC I'm not going to buy him which means I can't even try him in practice tool. There is a bunch of champions I will never play myself but I'm still able to tell what they going to do and how they work. This is not the case with Apheliose.
2861,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618581,Eh. I mean I’m not complaining about the champ. My only experience with him is seeing him in pro play and the clips on reddit that usually lack context. I have nothing to complain about because he’s never in my games other than at a quick glance I don’t know what he’s about to do.
2862,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618585,"i remember my first game against aphelios, i was chilling with a friend that told me to play garen. So i did, and it turned out it was an aphelios top. The whole laning phase was ""AHHH WTF IS THIS CHAMP I DONT KNOW WHAT HE DOES AAAAHHH HES MELTING ME HELP"". If i cant tell what your champion does after watching 5 minutes of gameplay theres a problem.
[yes i read what he was like before release as well]"
2863,5e385ad2841d20c9f2618589,"ok its more clear now where are you coming from and why riven is confusing to you. Fair enough, I'll try to help you as much as possible in couple of sentences. So, basically riven is allowed to sneak autoattacks between every ability or partial ability (the tripple Q) she uses, thus, if she manages to land a full combo on someone by a person whom hands are fast enough and learned how to sneak the autos (aka the animation canceling), she gets plenty of extra unavoidable damage which no other champion is allowed to do. Imagine an Aatrox who can fast autoattack after each Q, but because of that his next Q comes even faster, because the autoattack canceled the animation of between the two Qs, but also the next Q is allowing his next autoattack to come faster as well because it cancelled the previous autoattack animation, but not the effect and so on and so on or imagine a Garen who can autoattack between every spin of his E, but the autoattack also makes next E spin comes faster which makes his next autoattack  comes faster etc. Well this is what a fast handed Riven players do and this is what Riven as a champion is allowed to have because... reasons :)"
2864,5e385ad3841d20c9f261858d,You’re full of shut if you think any of those three look similar. Xayah and Rakan are much harder to differentiate. None of those three move remotely similar and Senna is bright green while the other two are purple.
2865,5e385ad3841d20c9f2618591,"This is not a discussion about whether league should have complex kits. a complex kit is fine, as long as the opponent can understand whats happening too. 

Invoker is complex, but his spells are still easy to understand as an enemy. You know what hes doing when he casts, which is where Aph is different. 

His kit is complex but also visually vague. You can't tell what hes doing and therefore cannot react or play around it accordingly."
2866,5e385ad3841d20c9f2618595,"Even invoker and brewmaster have good visual clarity, even if you dont understand what they are doing you can at least see it"
2867,5e385ad3841d20c9f2618599,"Yet league and Dora are vastly different, Dota is know for it's complexity, where as riot has nerfed/reverted things that made the game unappealing to newer players. I understand if that's what they want to do, make the game more complicated. However having simple champs like annie, and then also have aphelios is misdirection. You can't have it both ways"
2868,5e385ad3841d20c9f261859d,"He's not super complex though, he's just complicated. Those are two very different concepts, and Aphelios falls heavily into the complicated corner without having a lot of complexity to his name. His weapon and ammo system gate him heavily into only ever having one combination of weapons to play with for most of the time which switch out periodically, with the only timeframe where he can be slightly more active with his decisions being when his ammo is low enough to burst through a weapon real quick. But most of the time you're gonna use one of several combos that have been chosen for you that have fairly simple interactions with each other and allow you access to a fairly simple ult. It's all very complicated because you have to learn what all of these different combos and ults do by heart and makes him an ungodly nuisance to play against because you have to go to the wiki and study his whole kit a bunch just to do so which is honestly kinda offensive, but there's not a whole lot of depth beyond that.

More complex kits are great, but that's not what Aphelios offers. Aphelios is pretentious bullshit with all of the depth of a puddle that hides how goddamn shallow his kit is by making it all needlessly complicated. He doesn't offer complexity, he offers the illusion of it."
2869,5e385ad3841d20c9f26185a1,"Invoker, strangely enough, is significantly easier to understand. Most of his spells either have a strong telegraph or have an effect over time."
2870,5e385ad3841d20c9f26185a5,Reddit would rather kick and scream about how he's on their permanent ban list instead of playing him in 5 normals to realize what he's capable of doing. The Aphelios circlejerk here is probably the most smooth brain hivemind whining I've seen in a while
2871,5e385ad3841d20c9f26185a9,"It doesn't matter if I know what each of his guns do, when I don't know what combo he has at that moment because I can't see his back or it's a teamfight and I can't tell what gun is on his back."
2872,5e385ad3841d20c9f26185ad,"Personally for me Q wise from least to greatest is Gravitum because it’s a 1 second root, Infernum because unless you’re close most of the damage will miss, Calibrum because it’s hard to land for the poke it grants,  Cresendum is a turrent that’s useful to try and get someone to enagage on you, and Serverum because of the fast pace attacks.

 Ult wise from least to greatest Cresendum for it only spawns extra mini weapons, Gravitum because it only applies a slow unless he Q’s, Calibrum because it only marks every champion hit, Serverum because it grants 200-400 lifesteal, and Infernum. Infernum ult definitely needs a nerf because it does 75% bonus damage from the Aoe splash, and the splash it self will go in a circle around an enemy instead of a cone. Not to mention you can be hit by multiple splash’s. The ult itself will travel slightly slower than Ezeral’s ult.

Gesh everything is an essay with this champ."
2873,5e385ad3841d20c9f26185b1,Ah well I didn’t learn a champ after two games better just give up and proceed to complain on Reddit
2874,5e385ad3841d20c9f26185b5,"Really didn’t want to go into a paragraph, but hey it’s Aphelios. How can you not.

No, it’s not items. Aphelios has a passive were he will switch 5 weapons. Each weapon has 50 ammo, meaning you can attack 50 times or use 5 Q’s before it switch’s to the back of the rotation. The default rotation is Calibrum ( long range sniper), serverum (shorter range lifesteal), gravitum (Slow and short root), Infernum (Aoe), and Cresendum (Faster attacks the closer in range you get). You can mess with the rotation depending on what you run out of first."
2875,5e385ad3841d20c9f26185b9,"This guy is probably one of those who gets ""held back"" by his teammates and that's why he is in gold."
2876,5e385ad3841d20c9f26185bd,Thats a good idea its clean and easy to tell at a glance. Could make his MH larger than the others with a yellow border. OH Smaller with a blue border and the ones unused greyed out and small. The icons would have to be coded to each gun.
2877,5e385ad3841d20c9f26185c1,"Don't even need symbols, just use the same bars that she has and have their unique colors on each bar in order since each weapon is associated with a different color (blue infernum, red severum, purple gravitum, white crescendum, and green sniper)"
2878,5e385ad3841d20c9f26185c5,A simple color (like jhin reload system with 3 dots a color each) would suffice.
2879,5e385ad3841d20c9f26185c9,It doesn't even have to be symbols. Each gun already have a unique color so they can just put 3 colors above his head.
2880,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185cd,"yeah sure and put people's skill cd above their character, that would be great. not backing off when you have this character runnin into you is a mistake that doesn' come from riot's side."
2881,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185d1,"New jax skin is bullshit, I can't tell if he pressed r or e"
2882,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185d5,Wait this is the most obvious fix imaginable. Just swap the indicator out for the offhand
2883,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185d9,">Although as he gets new skins, it’s going to be kind of annoying “relearning” which gun is which. And imagine, a couple years from now, when a new player joins and has to learn which gun is which con Aphelios in his base skin and the 6 other skins he’ll probably have by then. Hell, sometimes I still get confused on which form is which with Kayns on-release skin...

YES. So much YES.  


LET'S MAKE ASSASSIN KAYN RED ON HIS RELEASE SKIN GUYS  
i hate this so much."
2884,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185dd,I do wish there was an option to disable skins on the enemy team
2885,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185e1,"grammar is a bit misleading, I just meant that since Doublelift wasn't aware of what gun was on aphelios' offhand he wasn't prepared to dodge a skillshot hard CC. The brackets was just an aside"
2886,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185e5,That’s how I imagine them “gutting” him. But I also don’t mind him being able to R instantly. I think the problem is more not knowing what weapon he is on since it makes a difference
2887,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185e9,"Oh you are right. My brain 100% skipped over the second half of that sentence, by bad."
2888,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185ed,I don't really understand that tbh
2889,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185f1,"Ah, hello Overwatch devs!"
2890,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185f5,This was his last champ so I'm pretty sure they just gave him free reign to do whatever the fuck he wanted.
2891,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185f9,"They did that when he worked on ww rework and look what that gave us, one of the best reworks(if it didnt had all the bugs) that can tie even with sion or urgot for the title."
2892,5e385ad4841d20c9f26185fd,"Are you intentionally ignoring the complaints people are bringing up? It's that it's hard to tell which one of these ""sometimes"" conditions are a out to happen."
2893,5e385ad4841d20c9f2618601,"certainlyT champions are never overly complicated, it's just that they tend to be overloaded as fuck(everything you mentioned above. Exhibit A akali, exhibit B yasuo) or not very clear( exhibit A MS slows reducing kalista's attack speed, exhibit B aphelio's guns. Very hard to see offhand weapons)"
2894,5e385ad4841d20c9f2618605,Why don’t they just put the symbol of the weapon in the moonlight that travels?
2895,5e385ad5841d20c9f2618609,"His ult is basically a longer-range larger-aoe Q. It does damage and applies his passive mark to every enemy hit by the ability, which forego his usual range limit.

The differences between R and Q for each of the weapons:

Sniper: one mark -> multiple Marks (and they do more damage)  
Gravity gun: root -> 99% slow for 3.5sec, decaying to 10% after 0.7 sec  
Flamethrower: cone -> radial  
Pistol: rapidly alternate shots with mainhand and offhand -> heal for 200/300/400 health if one enemy is hit. Does not scale with number of enemies hit.  
Chakrams: offhand Chakram throw (multiple chakrams thing) -> additional chakrams.

I’ve tried to keep it simple and clear, but the chakram R is such an ass to describe."
2896,5e385ad5841d20c9f261860d,"By that definition aphelios is pretty bad design, I agree (surprise, CertainlyT champs disregard riots “design philosophies”). Although I still think this is blown out of proportion.

This post in particular complains about the clarity of the ult but really it’s quite straightforward that when aphelios has his purple gun he can root you with his ult. Personally I don’t think that ignorance of a kit’s capability can be excused by design flaws but if riot says it can then then they’re right.

If people spent the same time learning apehlios’s kit as they do complaining about it they probably wouldn’t have as many complaints. OP doesn’t even spell his name right so why would we assume they’ve taken any necessary measure to learn his kit? Spend 5 minutes with the champion in practice tool and you’ll probably be surprised that it’s not as confusing as you think (albeit still more than most champions) and I’m a jungle main."
2897,5e385ad5841d20c9f2618611,They also used that as a dig for Dota...
2898,5e385ad5841d20c9f2618615,"For the opponent to know what is going on, the only need for clarity is in the ability to know his offhand weapon at all times. And icon by the HP bar would suffice.

I dont need to know all the nuance of how he levels to effectively play against him. All I need to know is he gains stats... like any champ... and has a power spike at levels 2 and 6... like most champs.

I do need to know with no room for ambiguity what both of his guns are. Hell, I'd argue even his next gun when he drops below a certain amount of ammo. I'm okay having to look up the tooltips, but not ok with having to memorize the appearance of the model for each gun in each hand position from each angle. Give me a fucking icon."
2899,5e385ad5841d20c9f2618619,"Actually it's blatantly obvious which ult he's using. Firstly it's pretty clear he switched to gravitum before ulting, secondly there's a pretty clear purple hue to the ult (although I do agree this could benefit from being slightly more defined).

Regardless, his offhand shows gravitum, so people should be prepared for an ult that's going to root them. 

If he ults out of fog it's a completely different story. If it was clear that the ult was gravitum, do you really think people would be able to see the ult just before it hits them, process which type of ult it is, and then react accordingly? Maybe. But again it has a hue to it (which could be more clear but is clearer than most people on this sub admit).

I'm more concerned with the fact that most of these aphelios-whining posts are really just lazy people who don't spend the time learning a new champs kit and have to learn the hard way. If they spent the same time learning his kit as they did complaining about it on the league sub they wouldn't have any problems. I'm a jungle main so it's not like I'm going out of my way to defend a champion I don't want removed."
2900,5e385ad5841d20c9f261861d,Jungle main so I’m currently enjoying “abusing” j4 and Olaf xd
2901,5e385ad5841d20c9f2618621,Yeah hence why were constantly complaining about his bullshit design lmao
2902,5e385ad5841d20c9f2618625,more like its intended to have 3 ults to choose from.
2903,5e385ad5841d20c9f2618629,"I think its okay for a good Aphelios player to be able to use 3 or 4 weapon abilities with the low ammo mechanic. 

The problem is, enemy player MUST be able to tell what Aphelios will be able to do, which guns can he use, and if he's low on ammo, which weapon will he get next."
2904,5e385ad5841d20c9f261862d,"Yeah, that's not what I'm arguing for. I play Aphelios quite often and I'm an advocate for clarity changes. 

Putting some odd cooldown on his weapon swaps/r after swaps is not the way to go around stuff."
2905,5e385ad5841d20c9f2618631,"you can force the reload with a Q though (for like, chakram and sniper, not a huge dps loss)"
2906,5e385ad5841d20c9f2618635,There's a cast time when he switches weapons isn't there? I feel like when I have to switch weapons there is a small cast animation where I'm locked out of instantly using abilities or attacks with the next weapon.
2907,5e385ad5841d20c9f2618639,I think it'd be cool if q w e r were like normal abilities that are different guns or something
2908,5e385ad5841d20c9f261863d,CertainlyT is reading your post right now and masturbating furiously. In his interview with travis he talked about how introducing these kinds of frustrations for players is exactly the kind of stuff het gets off to
2909,5e385ad5841d20c9f2618641,"Simply make the option - Show Champion Name above the Health bar instead of the player's nickname, that should solve the problem."
2910,5e385ad5841d20c9f2618645,"I think the entire mecha kingdom line is so hard to tell who is who at a glance. Terrible skinline imo. 

And this is just a personal issue but I always have trouble telling if it's Zed or Shen when they have certain skins on. There are other skins in the game that throw me off too but I couldn't name them all. 

Clarity seems to be going down the drain these days."
2911,5e385ad6841d20c9f2618649,"Seems like one possible solution would be for Riot to add a UI feature along the lines of ""display default skins only."" I'm very unknowledgeable about the tech behind the game and imagine this could require design reworks but seems like it should be an option."
2912,5e385ad6841d20c9f261864d,"DotA 2 community started joking about ""glance value"" when they started adding weird cosmetics to the game because there were clear rules in place before that for what a hero could and couldn't wear. I believe the general idea was that you wanted the hero's silhouette and color palette to be conserved, which imo are good guidelines to follow. 

DotA's gone off the rails since then, but I think about those guidelines whenever I load into a game of League after not playing for a few months and see some shitty skin that requires me to stop and think about the champion I'm looking at. At least Swamp Master Kennen still moved like base Kennen, the newest Udyr skin for example moves a lot like TF, and that one legitimately caught me off-guard recently."
2913,5e385ad6841d20c9f2618651,"You are not alone. I mess up every so often, and I am teaching a new friend, and he absolutely hates skins. There's already so much to learn. All these skins do is cause him anxiety."

2915,5e385ad6841d20c9f2618659,Blood Moon Jhin looks like Talon and it confuses me every single time.
2916,5e385ad6841d20c9f261865d,I agree with this 100%. I can’t recognize some of the characters until they do a move I know and then I have the moment of— ohhh that’s a Darius who just dunked me. I would have played that totally differently had I known that.
2917,5e385ad6841d20c9f2618661,"Best example is, is that a Zed skin a Shen skin or a Lee Sin skin?"

2919,5e385ad6841d20c9f2618669,I still have trouble with even identifying Morg or Soraka with those glowy light skins (is it Star Guardian?). They look very similar and not like their characters at all.
2920,5e385ad6841d20c9f261866d,It's even more annoying cause there's fucking skins and champ icons that look like other ones at a glance now too. I can't remember what the skins are but there's a jarvan and xin skin I think that make them both the almost same colour palette and similar shape so at a glance it's harder to tell which the fuck it is sometimes.
2921,5e385ad6841d20c9f2618671,(Base skins only option)

2924,5e385ad6841d20c9f261867d,"There are champs that look exactly the same with skins...

It's ridiculous. Just give me the option to show the champs in base skin when in-game, except for my own"
2925,5e385ad7841d20c9f2618681,Same here.  Seems like a nearly ubiquitous problem too - it's happened to me about a dozen times within a month - super difficult to tell who's who at a glance with a lot of these skins.
2926,5e385ad7841d20c9f2618685,"You're not alone. Coming back after a while, seeing Garens 'floating' animation in new skin, I thought, wtf, am I getting lagged or is it just a visual bug that I've seen multiple times here in reddit?"
2927,5e385ad7841d20c9f2618689,"Oh my god yes, I thought I was the only one! There are several new skins that look like other champions, it's extremely annoying. Something that happened when I returned to the game (a year ago) and keeps happening (it was funny at first but stopped being funny at some point) was me shouting ""what the fuck is this?"" when an enemy laner appears into a teamfight or ganks for the first time. I really can't tell sometimes.

Also a lot of skins have very ""invisible"" spells lately. There were always some older skins, like that Lux one that was disabled in LCS, but now it's getting out of hand. I recently had big trouble with that Ashe skin with the horse. Her spells are very translucent and similar to each other."

2932,5e385ad7841d20c9f261869d,"Yeah, heavens forbid you look at the loading screen and see you're playing against a Lux.

God knows she can metamorph into Ezreal and when you see that Pajama Guardian skin you just can't tell who it is!"
2933,5e385ad7841d20c9f26186a1,"Of all the complaints you could have, this is literally one of the stupidest."
2934,5e385ad7841d20c9f26186a5,"I think that’s the point. Blaming myself for this too; there isn’t any other game we want to play. For some of us, nothing replaces the high of winning a ranked game. Sad but true."
2935,5e385ad7841d20c9f26186a9,"There is a lot of indications the playerbase is on the way down, mostly that Riot lost a billion dollars of revenue back in 2018 which is just a ludicrous amount. Like actually an unbelievable loss.

2938,5e385ad7841d20c9f26186b5,"Hey how about you describe 1 ability ? You want me to mention Senna's Passive ? Are you sure ? 

Absolution	
INNATE - WEAKENED SOUL: Senna's basic attacks and abilities on enemy champions apply Mist for 4 seconds. Senna's next attack collects the Mist and deals 1% − 16% (based on level) of target's current health Attack damage bonus physical damage. The same target cannot be collected more than once every few seconds.

Enemy Champion large minions and large monsters that die near Senna spawn a Mist Wraith for 8 seconds. Epic monsters spawn 2 Mist Wraiths instead. Minions and lesser monsters have a 20% chance to spawn Mist Wraiths, reduced to 1.67% chance on those that Senna kills. Senna can basic attack a Mist Wraith to destroy it, gaining Gold 3 and collecting its Mist.

ABSOLUTION: Each stack of Mist grants Senna 1 bonus attack damage. For every 20 stacks, Senna also gains  25 bonus range and 15% critical strike chance. Upon exceeding 100% critical strike chance, Senna converts 35% of the excess into Life steal .

Absolution 2	
RELIC CANNON: Senna basic attacks deal 20% AD bonus physical damage on-hit and grant 10 / 15 / 20% of the target's movement speed as Movement speed for 0.5 seconds on-hit.

And Here is Malphite Passive that you Described :
SHARD OF THE MONOLITH: Malphite's size scales with his maximum armor (before applying Thunderclap Thunderclap's bonus armor), capped at around 850 maximum armor.

Granite Shield	
INNATE: Malphit shields himself for Health icon 10% maximum health. The shield lasts until it is broken, and refreshes if he has not taken damage in the last few seconds."

I could have no fucking clue about chakras and crysanthymum and w/e the fuck as long as I know with absolute unwavering clarity when he can either root me with Gravitron or aoe teamwipe us with Infernal Nasus."
2948,5e385ad8841d20c9f26186dd,He’s literally the only champ in the game you can’t essentially figure out by playing against him a few times. I’ve probably played against him 5-10 times and I never have any idea what his next attack will do. That’s different then the other 140 champs and indicates a terrible design.
2949,5e385ad8841d20c9f26186e1,"Just own all the heros!

Most accounts dont."
2950,5e385ad8841d20c9f26186e5,"This thread is about clarity, not necessarily strength. Even if the champ is so weak it's unplayable, it's a bad champion of you can't tell what it does."
2951,5e385ad8841d20c9f26186e9,"yeah it boggles my mind that some poeple's main takeaway from the champ is his ""gLoBal RaNgE"" as if he can just always auto you from anywhere with no counterplay. You have to get hit by a skillshot (infernum Q, calibrum Q, calibrum R), stand next to a severum channeling Aphelios, or walk into a calibrum turret to get marked. If his offhand weapon had more visual clarity (ie. an icon next his main gun on HP bar) then you shouldn't be getting marked without standing right next to aphelios or getting locked down"
2952,5e385ad8841d20c9f26186ed,"Remember when everyone was bitching about Neeko's 130% ap scaling?

Yea, oftentimes the thing most complained about is fully irrelevant."

2955,5e385ad8841d20c9f26186f9,It does about same as rank 2 headshot with IE ER if you crit and if you have 10stacks of chakram then it does more.
2956,5e385ad8841d20c9f26186fd,"The reason they gave for backing out of it was  hilarious. They didn't want to break the ""consistency of stealth"" or some bullshit. They say this for the champion they gave the ability to go invisible under towers."
2957,5e385ad8841d20c9f2618701,"Nobody but Aphelios is going to know what his R does every time he presses it.

We basically have an Udyr that instead of changing costumes to show what ability he's on just gets the half a second splash of the colored icon above his head when he uses it."
2958,5e385ad8841d20c9f2618705,"Bruv, it either does a lot of damage, heals him or sets up for an aoe root.

90% of the time you don't care about the heal and it's not coming as a surprise anyway because he has severum whipped out.

So it either hurts a lot or roots in aoe. The counterplay to both is don't sit close together.

Let's not pretend like you would play differently if you know what it was gonna do."
2959,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618709,"He's my main ADC at the moment and I feel he definitely needs changes in the clarity side of things.

* Seconday weapon shown next to primary weapon icon.
* Colour, shape or perhaps an icon in the vfx itself for ult depending on what weapon type the ult is (pref shape or icon due to colour blindness).
* Icon, colour or shape to help determine the turret type.

Changes like that would help determine what he's capable of. While you can't tell what weapon is coming next for him, you can tell when he's going to swap and he does have a delay while swapping weapons which leaves him open for a moment (this has killed me multiple times playing as phel)."
2960,5e385ad9841d20c9f261870d,Ive never played him once and understand what he does. I don't think it's hard but I do think that it depends on what kind of person you are. I'm hardcore into league and that's why I understand him. That's definitely not the case for most other people
2961,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618711,"Thank you. Just fucking play the character a couple times. He’s probably the most unique character released in a while, but he’s not as hard to understand as people are making him out to be, even if all you have the patience for is 10 minutes in the practice tool. Or maybe the community is just really fucking stupid, I don’t know."
2962,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618715,"I mean, the game would 100% be better without Aphelios so idk man removing that piece of shit champ does sound awesome.  

And im not like that with every new champ, Sett is fine, as an example. Yes he is strong, but he is fun to play & easy to understand, he is also **very** counterable, so yeah."
2963,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618719,Is he really blatantly OP? His winrates across all divisons dont really go beyond 50%.
2964,5e385ad9841d20c9f261871d,"He's not even unnecessarily complex, players are just refusing to learn the simplest of things about him.  He's only a hair more complex than, say, Karma with her multiple ults that do completely different things.  At least aphelios is a bunch of similar things with slightly different interactions."
2965,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618721,"It is entirely predictable, and his interactions are all based around simply having 5 weapons.  People do fine with nidalee and she has 4 spells + 4 more spells + 3 enhanced versions of the second set of spells.  

The only current issues with aphelios are having infinite range and a lack of clarity on his offhand.  Both of those are being remedied."
2966,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618725,This thread is based off the casters assuming the players didn't know something when they actually did.  So yes.  Your hostile defense of your ignorance is quite alarming.  You might want to re-examine the things you pride yourself on if you're pleased to say that you have trouble understanding his kit.
2967,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618729,"> 225% banrate.

This was a couple nerfs ago.  So everyone knew it needed a fix, and he got some fixes.  Your information and your mindset are outdated."
2968,5e385ad9841d20c9f261872d,"Sorry for the late response but, rito should hire you next for the Aphelios balance team! I’m loving these suggestions. But yeah, I don’t think Sett will he a problem at all I just don’t understand the people that defend him in his *current* state which is very overturned. I’m excited to see how he is after the upcoming nerf. 

Just having Calibrum/Severum/Gravitrum as the holy trinity for him sounds amazing to me, and I could imagine a lot of people on Reddit would support this as well. On top of a good visual marker to see the offhand (like an aura?) or a figure to show which ones are up, alongside this he would be in a great state. 

It’s just getting annoying tho since each new champ they release (besides Sett being overtuned), all of them have very strong overloaded kits which make it a nightmare to balance. Since I can’t imagine Aphelios, Senna, Akali, Qiyana and co. being fun to balance for them right? 

It takes a lot of testing, time, and multiple patches to get the champ to their optimal balanced state. Which makes it even harder on the player base because they have to tunnel onto the apparent issues."
2969,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618731,"Setts W needs a bit of tuning.

People who thinks hes OP should try playing him into any mobile/ranged champ, they all kinda fuck sett over in lane. With the whole no gapclose thing."
2970,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618735,"I agree with the comment above, they originally gave Sylas too much power on his basic abilities with the ult on top.

I personally feel his ult should be buffed and the rest of his kit nerfed lol. It's just such a unique and versatile ult, it's a shame that his basic abilities take up so much of his power budget. Like Sett's W being so good but the rest of his kit (*cough* Q) doing little to compensate."
2971,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618739,And her tank base stats
2972,5e385ad9841d20c9f261873d,"As a person with a lot of games on Qiyana. She does not hurt tanks. She can’t kill a bruiser or tank at any point in the game. The only things that change this is if she’s 1 item ahead or the bruiser/tank is hurt. In games that have Normal progression she’s never a threat to bulkier champions. 

Mages/Assassins/Supports/Adcs are always freebies though. The moment they stand in her range and she has all cds up they are dead."
2973,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618741,"It honestly doesnt do much lol. If you wanna hurt tanks you want spammable percent health damage like sett, rhaast etc. Having only one ability that does so doesnt help you win vs tanks. Any tank with one and a half item can comfortably take qiyanas whole combo."
2974,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618745,he was a normal upper tier midlaner and then his buffs made him semi-oppressive in the jungle
2975,5e385ad9841d20c9f2618749,Mid lane yes. Jlg however no.
2976,5e385ada841d20c9f261874d,Ekko was fine till they gave him +100% damage to his passive against monsters.
2977,5e385ada841d20c9f2618751,"Well atleast when when playing against akali you know whats going on.  
IMO akali Q needs a real cd (especially early) which would nerf the most oppressive part of her kit being able to Q passive Q passive without much counterplay in many mostly melee matchups"
2978,5e385ada841d20c9f2618755,Oh please rework akali when they removed tower stealth  was no where near disgusting as old-akali. In the current meta old akali would be just as much trouble as current akali is.
2979,5e385ada841d20c9f2618759,"hes on the tft team now, iirc aphelios was his last 'gift' to the community"
2980,5e385ada841d20c9f261875d,"The dude simply overloads abilites just for the sake of it. It's not enough for Zoe to steal summoners she also has to get move speed and deal extra damage after using it, ohh and also that applies to her own summoners as well. It's not enough that Zoe E is a stun, it gains range on walls and stays on the ground after missing it, where is the punishment in the spell you may ask, there isn't one.

 Same goes for Akali, her Q healed her, slowed and did insane damage, like why does every single spell need to have like 5 passive things in it."
2981,5e385ada841d20c9f2618761,"I personally don't have any strong feelings about CertainlyT's champions/reworks, but I think it's just weird how many people basically fully accredit Aphelios' kit to him when pretty much the entirety of the implementation of him was Stashu.   
In fact, thinking about it, if CertianlyT *did* have full control over his design, he would probably have a weapon that gives stealth, an execute, and probably mobility. I was actually kind of shocked at how simple Aphelios ended up being released as."
2982,5e385ada841d20c9f2618765,"disciplined =/= fire

But if an inquest into the operations of these teams revealed that there's actual people sitting on their ass and smoking weed all day while signing off on releases, then sure, they would most likely be invited to leave the company with cause.

Additionally, it isn't a character I dislike, it's a character that is objectively poorly designed and bad for the game, and it's not ONE character, it's a recurring issue with recent champions and reworks which shows that there are underlying problems in Riot's process that need to be reviewed ASAP."
2983,5e385ada841d20c9f2618769,"Morde literally doesn't need to do anything to win fights, and becomes extremely difficult to kite with just one item (rylai's). A champion that can force you to 1v1 one him shouldn't be able to automatically win nearly any 1v1 just by standing on top of someone without autoing or using abilities."
2984,5e385ada841d20c9f261876d,"There NEEDS to be a disable skins option. Skins are for yourself not your enemies, let me see the base skins"

2986,5e385ada841d20c9f2618775,"I know some other games have different settings for different color blindness, but your point stands"
2987,5e385ada841d20c9f2618779,"Yeah he just seems like a champ I would have to play to know what he does. My friends who play aphelios know what he does, those who don’t have no clue. I don’t play him and I ban him so I dont know. Easy life."
2988,5e385ada841d20c9f261877d,"That does sound kinda bonkers and explains why I die so quickly to her haha, that's certainly more complicated than I had thought, when I hear animation cancels I think of either riven or the only animation cancel (if that's what it is) that I know of which is yasuo W + Q but clearly Riven's animation cancel is allot more work for allot more damage."
2989,5e385ada841d20c9f2618781,"This. I really like Aphelios and what they were going for with him but I absolutely dread playing against one because of lack of visual clarity. It's not even that I don't know combos/playstyle but it's just exhausting counting his weapons order that changes from player to player or try to look at his back for the whole game. 

If I'm jungling, I should be able to look at every champion for a split second and decide which lane to gank, not wonder if Aphelios has gravitum on his back, if his off-hand is low ammo or he will swap to it soon etc. You just can't tell any of this from a first glance at the moment and it reduces counterplay heavily."
2990,5e385ada841d20c9f2618785,"Maybe he should get an aura of the weapon color. He’s already anime, make him surrounded by red anime power when he has severum, white with crescendum, etc"
2991,5e385ada841d20c9f2618789,"> Invoker is complex, but his spells are still easy to understand as an enemy. You know what hes doing when he casts, which is where Aph is different. 

Bingo.  Invoker has 10 spells total and they're all incredibly distinct, especially by Dota's lower clarity standards.  Aphelios's ult alone has 5 variations that look near-identical but have very different effects, and that's before we get into interactions with secondary weapons."
2992,5e385ada841d20c9f261878d,"Dota also has extremely simple heroes. Wraith King has all of two active abilities, a point and click stun and the ability to summon an uncontrollable skeleton army (no micro even if you wanted to). You can have very simple and very complicated characters coexist just fine"
2993,5e385adb841d20c9f2618791,Knowing what he's capable of does not mean you can understand what an enemy is going to do or has available to them. For aphelios you must always assume that he can do the maximum damage in his kit. There is very little to tell you his actual damage output now and in the near future. Unlike most other champions who have clear cooldowns that you can remember and even guess at if you're playing more casually but for aphelios your best shot is to look at his current weapons and pray that he doesn't get a new one while you fight.
2994,5e385adb841d20c9f2618795,"Opposing Aph. That 1s root on Gravitum can be a death sentence. No, flashes allowed. It can allow for some sudden deaths alongside Aphs team.

Infernum Q helps wave clear fast. Even early game. Though I agree it's not reliably applied in team fights but not using Q means you have more ammo for AoE ranged autos.

That said, I roughly agree with your order. Just want to point out that even the ""least"" of his Qs is really strong with current tuning.

On the ult. His ult has good base so the specific augment it gets doesn't take away from that. Cresendum R is likely the weakest single interaction/mechanic in the entire kit. Gravitum R isn't that bad as its a 99% slow (does it decay to 10% after 0.7 seconds? Or a different value?) and lets you then get the root to prevent flashes. Though again I comment for the same reason as before.

Severum ult is a good example of how weirdly deep Aph is. It gives Aph a base heal that doesn't scale with targets. However, the basic R makes you auto everyone hit by R with your main hand weapon...which applies Severum's ""passive"" self healing. So the actual amount of healing Aph gets is a pretty wide spread of results.

But yeah everythings an essay and we're not *really* digging into the math. It works out the math is crazy because it's all scaling off autoattacking. So it gets super multiplicative."
2995,5e385adb841d20c9f2618799,"Personally I think infernums ult is fine atm, the nerfs they already did to it are decent. It’s only strong if the team is really clumped up, which it should be, that’s what its designed for. I find the crit splash on Infernums autos to be complete unnecessary personally but that might just be me."
2996,5e385adb841d20c9f261879d,Bro im not challenger because of trolls and afks
2997,5e385adb841d20c9f26187a1,"**Colorblind issues intensify.**

Edit: I was just trying to be silly given the context of trying to make Aphelios's kit seem more transparent to on-lookers at a quick glance.  I have since been informed that I have erred, and I now know that yellow and blue are generally the best colors for dealing with color blindness, and that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.

Thank you, mates, for clarifying."
2998,5e385adb841d20c9f26187a5,"And make simple icons. Crosshair for sniper gun, flame for flame thrower, boots standing in mud for root gun, etc. I really don't want to learn the names and icons of his guns."

3000,5e385adb841d20c9f26187ad,yep that ult looks like wtf.
3001,5e385adb841d20c9f26187b1,"you can clearly see the range on his E, and his R is a huge shield. its pretty clear. 

AND, you can see when his passive is fully stacked too!"
3002,5e385adb841d20c9f26187b5,"Ah, thank you."
3003,5e385adb841d20c9f26187b9,"probably because needed and mandatory are pretty much synonymous. Saying its ""not needed"" first makes it sound like hes saying nothing should be changed. I don't think its a big deal or on purpose, but just like Aphelios his comment could have used a touch more clarity."
3004,5e385adb841d20c9f26187bd,"Which is a pretty terrible thing for the game.

Besides, he's already had plenty of free reign with his previous designs."
3005,5e385adb841d20c9f26187c1,"Literally only one really affects how you play the game. You are playing the same way against all the other ones. It isn't complicated, and it is less of an issue in non-pro play since Aphelios's own team doesn't know, so they can't properly follow up most times."
3006,5e385adb841d20c9f26187c5,"Except Aphelios isn't overloaded as fuck since he has no mobility. I really think simply reducing the range of Calibrum snipe is going to fix most of the whining. 

I don't think tracking Aphelios's weapons is any harder than keeping track of any of the other cooldowns in the game.

Everyone is using DL getting caught out as an example. That is a bad example. That is an adc with limited mobility pushing past mid without a tower to fall back on and no teammates around for suport. If Kaisa landed a W snipe on him and insta ulted to kill him no one would be bitching. It was just a disrespectful, stupid play by DL and he got punished for it. The only reason it didn't happen sooner was Dig couldn't believe that he actually didn't have backup.

You can't see an Annie's flash cooldown. If you are squishy and you don't know whether it is up or not you have to play extra safe away from it. These are just basic mechanics of the game. People are just being extremely lazy with this regarding Aphelios for some reason."
3007,5e385adb841d20c9f26187c9,That would be really stylish
3008,5e385adb841d20c9f26187cd,"This is very good. So know I he has five guns. But that is about it.

Sometimes he has a purple ball gun, sometimes it is fidget spinner gun, sometimes it is red bar super healy gun, sometimes it is place a turret down gun.

My point is, until he is on free rotation, I will never understand him. You cant learn him from just watching like you can get a just for other champions."
3009,5e385adb841d20c9f26187d1,This champ is a fucking mess...
3010,5e385adc841d20c9f26187d5,"I have read and learned his kit, I do not play him.

I cant fucking waste time looking at little kitty bitty teeny guns on him model just so I know what his entire kit does. Give me an icon so I can quickly and easily access the information I spent time learning."
3011,5e385adc841d20c9f26187d9,"Well no, that's stupid. Just have an icon up for his next weapon whenever he is below a certain ammo count."
3012,5e385adc841d20c9f26187dd,"Yeah, it's his reload. Doing that twice in a fight is...not good lol"
3013,5e385adc841d20c9f26187e1,"Remove leech gun, become ranged Udyr. Im ok with it"
3014,5e385adc841d20c9f26187e5,"Oh, I know. The fact that guy is employed is a travesty."
3015,5e385adc841d20c9f26187e9,This is such a good idea

3017,5e385adc841d20c9f26187f1,"I was thinking of an option ""Show Enemy Default Skins"" would be an amazing but unlikely fix. 

Edit: Upon writing this I was fully aware of WHY that won't happen which is why I said ""unlikely""."

3019,5e385adc841d20c9f26187f9,Or make it an option to turn off skins for yourself.
3020,5e385adc841d20c9f26187fd,"This is an option in Dota 2 if I recall. At the very least, Dota assigns each player a unique color at the start of the match so that you can then know which hero is based off the border on the mini map."

3022,5e385adc841d20c9f2618805,Can we have an option to load base skins? An option in settings that converts all other champs (all 9) to their base skin.
3023,5e385adc841d20c9f2618809,Or even bigger brain: let us disable skins with a toggle.

3026,5e385adc841d20c9f2618815,Thank you. People keep talking about how cool the skins look and I’m like I can’t even tell who’s who
3027,5e385add841d20c9f2618819,"Yes it's the worst skinline for clarity for me as well. Just had a game with a friend yesterday, where a Mecha Kingdom Jax ganked him and he was like ""WAIT THEY HAVE A SETT? oh nevermind it was Jax"" because they look all so different from the base skin and very similar to other champs from that skinline."
3028,5e385add841d20c9f261881d,The Sett skin looks nothing like him imo and I’ve mistaken him for a Darius multiple times..
3029,5e385add841d20c9f2618821,I find myself looking at the minimal to work out who is who.
3030,5e385add841d20c9f2618825,The new Jax skin looks nothing like any other Jax skin.
3031,5e385add841d20c9f2618829,"Don't forget all the purple skins coming out these days. Star guardian zoe, xayah, rakan. I can't recogize immediately who's who."
3032,5e385add841d20c9f261882d,They will literally never ever do that. No reason for people to buy skins with that option.
3033,5e385add841d20c9f2618831,"Then there's no point in buying skins, they'll never do it"
3034,5e385add841d20c9f2618835,That de-incentivizes the people who buy skins to gain an advantage. It's all about the money.
3035,5e385add841d20c9f2618839,Now imagine letting CertainlyR work on skin team.
3036,5e385add841d20c9f261883d,As a support main I look at the mini map more than my screen and tend to know who’s who by the mini map. But I’m the middle of a fight one of this funky skins comes out of a bush and it’s all guessing from there. The name of the champion on top of the HP bar seems like the best bandaid fix for this clarity issue.
3037,5e385add841d20c9f2618841,Colors don't matter when you don't remember which champ had which pijamas color.
3038,5e385add841d20c9f2618845,"Every new jinx skin is geniunely terrible, they dont even try to make her ult look like a rocket"
3039,5e385add841d20c9f2618849,Breaking a Champion's sillohuette is also something riot was against back in the day. So this arguement is actually more valid than you would have thought.
3040,5e385add841d20c9f261884d,how so? do any other skins gain appendages
3041,5e385add841d20c9f2618851,Every so often my friend group tries new shit it really helps keep it fresh and returning to league after a couple months hiatus helps us remember why we enjoy it. Also if you're just looking for those sweet sweet dopamine hits play a BR chicken dinners are always nice.
3042,5e385add841d20c9f2618855,you know other games have ranked mode right
3043,5e385ade841d20c9f2618859,So true. This game is like Heroin. You want to play another game but just no other game gives you this satisfaction you are looking for. But in the long run you just get frustration.
3044,5e385ade841d20c9f261885d,"The problem is that the game isn't attracting new players while simultaneously losing its older base. The skill cap is pretty high and there's just too much time investment to even get basic things like csing down. Personally, I've had less and less time to play the game as I've gotten older and have basically been ARAM only for like a year. It's the only short game mode"
3045,5e385ade841d20c9f2618861,"Of course there bloody is, the game is 10 fucking years old. Tell me a game that hasn't lost part of it's playerbase in that much time. It's still just bloody burnout.

It's still the most played game on the planet and as far as viewers go the most watched esport there is. Again, AFTER 10 YEARS. And if Riot can actually pull off all the stuff they showed at the anniversary that's bound to stay that way for quite a while. But the reality is that people will get bored and drop the game for a while or for good, it's just what happens."
3046,5e385ade841d20c9f2618865,"the majority of his champs are below 50% winrate

before the ""because they nerfed them"" comment comes, that's the responsibility of the balance team, not certainlyT. CertainlyT's job was specifically to make fun champions, the balance team has a ""release it imbalanced, collect data from that because players discover shit way faster than they could on their own, then nerf it into balance"" champion release strategy. That leads to frustrated players."
3047,5e385ade841d20c9f2618869,"Buddy I don’t really care let’s be real here, if you didn’t notice my reply was making fun of you. Listing what an ability/a champ does gets tiring real fast.

I can however summarize that for you:

Senna kills things, or autos champ twice, Senna gets souls and deals extra damage on the second auto. Senna gains range/crit chance/lifesteal  when she gets more stacks.

For something that is incredibly simple, it’s written out very lengthly to have complete clarity on how she gains stacks and where they come from, and what she gains from it.  For a champ that can’t build AS the benefits she gets aren’t that mind blowing honestly, issue is largely with numbers."
3048,5e385ade841d20c9f261886d,"He saw Aph ulti in a clustefuck of people and he was at around 60-70%. There is no way to calculate how much dmg he would have taken. I am one of the biggest Kobbe fans out here but he should have ultied/healed. It was the safe play and he would lose pretty much nothing. 

If reddit ought to have taught us sth is that Aph ulti into a clusterfuck -> 1shot."

3053,5e385ade841d20c9f2618881,"You did watch EG vs TSM right? he hits the calibrum snipe on Dardoch which then splashes gravitum to Kobbe through Runaan's which Bang pops to kill Kobbe. Don't tell me that is about ""shouldn't be getting marked"" that's absolute bs."
3054,5e385ade841d20c9f2618885,"Speaking of his turret, some sort of icon or colour based indicator on the turret along with the HP bar would be good too. Sometimes it's hard to identify what turret it is.

(I play aphelios and love him but he needs clarity changes like this for sure)."
3055,5e385ade841d20c9f2618889,IKR like his turrets don’t last 20 seconds anyways /s
3056,5e385ade841d20c9f261888d,"It boggles my mind that people like you downplay this global range aspect and consider it acceptable.


Doesnt matter how niche or specific it has to be, the fact that IT IS POSSIBLE,  is enough to warrant a nerf.


Besides, it wasnt THAT RARE to do."
3057,5e385ade841d20c9f2618891,Was fun how Neeko ended up only being viable as onhit toplaner.
3058,5e385ade841d20c9f2618895,Funny that these two are also designed by CertainlyT lol
3059,5e385ade841d20c9f2618899,"Yeah, but that is their abillities. Aphelios literally can choose a free stat between AD, AS or ArP every level lol"
3060,5e385adf841d20c9f261889d,The important thing Riot has to note is that Akali has more invisibility than any other champion has had ever before except for possibly the assassin rework Khazix where his r evlove gave him invis in brush. She can move anywhere she needs to within her invisibility and she can move anywhere she needs to outside of it. There’s not a window of attack if you aren’t an aoe spellcaster and even then she can dodge easily
3061,5e385adf841d20c9f26188a1,"His R projectile has different shades of color based on his main hand. Try it in champ practice. His pistol ult is red, his grav cannon ult is purple, etc

The only problem is that the colors aren't distinct enough. Chakram, rifle and flamethrower ults look quite similar due to their color."
3062,5e385adf841d20c9f26188a5,"Probably go a bit further than that tbh. There are a whole bunch of primary and secondary weapon interactions that frankly don't make a lick a sense, and things being intuitive and logical are rather important when it comes to letting people play against the champion effectively without having to study him more extensively than any champion they'd ever want to play themselves. Shit like Infernum Q letting you shoot the enemy with your offhand weapon or Calibrum marks hitting people with your offhand weapon are completely nonsensical.

Of course, that'll make him even more shallow so at that point he should probably get reworked anyways, but that champion desperately needs a lot more ""understood after getting hit by it"" and a lot less ""understood after extensively researching the subject on the wiki"" in his kit, and that requires that his interactions feel intuitive and don't involve random Chakrams flying at you from three screens away because reasons."
3063,5e385adf841d20c9f26188a9,Pro Players are pretty 'hardcore into league' too and they're still getting bootyblasted without seeing it coming (Like Kobbe twice today).
3064,5e385adf841d20c9f26188ad,"Well yes most players are Bronze-Silver and that reflects a lot here. Don't spend 5 minutes watching a champion spotlight then go ""bUt i dOn'T gEt iT"". Before people say you can understand other champions just by watching them, there's a limit to how far that goes for most champs. Even if we look at someone like Singed you would never know all the stats his ult gives just by looking at him. Or that Ashe can't crit normally but can crit slow."
3065,5e385adf841d20c9f26188b1,I think Yasuo is about as hard to understand as Aphelios for new players.  The bigger thing with Aphelios is they just need more hud elements.  If they had a colored ammo count and the circle the offhand boom you have all the info besides whats up next.  And I think thats a cool hide your gun element that you can now respect better with the ammo counter.  Give him Corki's rocket bars for every 10 ammo or something.
3066,5e385adf841d20c9f26188b5,"Most importantly, Sett is fun* to *PLAY AGAINST*

Granted you know how he works

*I mean that it doesnt feel unfair, it feels like its all in your hands, if you are better than the summoner using sett you will win and thats mostly it, unlike most new champions that _FEEL_ ass to play against and unfair, even it they arent objectively unfair(which is just bad game design)"
3067,5e385adf841d20c9f26188b9,"I mean, the game would 100% be better without Yasuo so idk man removing that piece of shit champ sound awesome.

And im not like that with every mobile champ, Lee Sin is fine, as an example. Yes he is strong, but he is fun to play & easy to understand, he is also **very** counterable, so yeah."
3068,5e385adf841d20c9f26188bd,"He has a 220% banrate in Korea. Yes, 220%. Must be balanced tho."
3069,5e385adf841d20c9f26188c1,"I literally said not for aphelios. I meant IF a champion, a hypothetical champion, is busted, then it should be disabled at least temporarily."
3070,5e385adf841d20c9f26188c5,"So lack of clarity but entirely predictable ?
OK man. How could this even work, I cant see his second weapon, so i cant predict everything. 
About your exemple, little tip, you know what nida can do based on what form she's on ;)"
3071,5e385adf841d20c9f26188c9,"His kit is understandable, but the clarity is just not there, and it's being proven and proven time and time again. But I suppose you can see the game much better than casters and pros, so alas, your pride is justified. Go and lead the fray on the rift, you beautiful mastermind."
3072,5e385adf841d20c9f26188cd,"I agree, I'm honestly not even sure he needs a straight up nerf. Right now his W is way overturned and his Q is way undertuned and there has to be a healthy balance."
3073,5e385adf841d20c9f26188d1,"I haven't played her but, in seriously starting my climb this season, i've been running Zed/Diana and feeling Zed is a bit underwhelming. Is Qiyana fun? Been thinking about picking her up"
3074,5e385adf841d20c9f26188d5,The point is she isn’t even trying to kill the tank but hits them with a massive aoe and does some good damage to them as well in addition to her primary target(s)
3075,5e385adf841d20c9f26188d9,were you around for tank ekko by any chance
3076,5e385adf841d20c9f26188dd,"Tbf, the shitty jungle changes also made him oppressive in jungle."
3077,5e385ae0841d20c9f26188e1,He's already been moved from TFT to another project.
3078,5e385ae0841d20c9f26188e5,"You could take out Zoe E puddle, her passive, and the ""using summoners gives 3 floating orbs"" part of her kit and she would still be fine.

Now imagine trying to do something similar to like garen or nasus."
3079,5e385ae0841d20c9f26188e9,"Akali Q never did insane damage.

3094,5e385ae0841d20c9f2618925,"Yeah, I actually think Mecha is even more clear that regular jax. If he uses e his aa animation changes and personally I see the difference between his E and R spheres instantly.

I'm actually really confused how many people can't tell the difference between a huge aoe and him swinging his weapon above his head and a way smaller shield directly around him."
3095,5e385ae1841d20c9f2618929,"True. My sentence lacked clarity, just like Aphelios *badum tsss*.

3097,5e385ae1841d20c9f2618931,and all of his other designs have been some of the best champions in all of LoL with great amounts of counter play and skill expersion when playing as and against those champions. Aphelios is a champion he didn't design but only helped with. He did not have any final say and only helped a bit with what is another designers champion.
3098,5e385ae1841d20c9f2618935,"Check the second half. I specifically mentioned aphelios in the not very clear category, not the overloaded as fuck category"
3099,5e385ae1841d20c9f2618939,Would also allow for more fun when it comes to skins
3100,5e385ae1841d20c9f261893d,"Yeah, what guns he has on him isn’t clear at all. You can see his mainhand, but his offhand is frequently invisible and you don’t know at all what weapon is queued up next."
3101,5e385ae1841d20c9f2618941,"Cliff notes, offered to you as much as they’re practice for me:

Purple ball gun: gravity gun, Gravitum. Applies a decaying slow on hit. If you use Q while they’re being slowed, they get rooted.  
Fidget spinner gun: chakrams, Crescendum. Throws chakram which returns to him. Aphelios is disarmed until it’s returned. Activating it (Q) puts down a turret which fires his offhand, applying all of the off-hands effects.    
Flamethrower: Infernum. Basic attacks get conal splash (think graves ult). Critting increases the width of the cone. Activation hits all enemies in a cone (doing damage), then attacks with his off-hand.  
Super Healy gun: severum. Attacks have lifesteal (increasing with levels) and store excess healing as an overshield (identical to and stacking with the Overheal rune). Activation: rapid attacks, alternating between mainhand and offhand.  
Sniper rifle: calibrum. Attacks have increased range. Activation shoots forward a projectile. The first enemy hit by the projectile can be attacked with calibrum for increased damage and at much larger range (currently global but it’s getting nerfed last I heard)."
3102,5e385ae1841d20c9f2618945,"I agree, an icon would be helpful and make things more clear, but this can’t be chalked up to “bad champion design” just maybe an oversight on how clear they thought his offhand was."
3103,5e385ae1841d20c9f2618949,I was confused by what you said but I realize I was talking about the same thing. Being able to use 4 abilities sounds cool until you realize that the interactions take like 4 seconds to do and you're likely wasting at least 3 of them. People downvoting you are probably the same people who can't be bothered to learn how he works on a basic level.
3104,5e385ae1841d20c9f261894d,but then its not unique and they couldn't tweak their nipples over it.
3105,5e385ae1841d20c9f2618951,This is just what happens when you emplore a guy with 0 experience in the field of game design before joining riot! Every single one of his champions has been an issue!
3106,5e385ae1841d20c9f2618955,And that's precisely why it won't he implemented.
3107,5e385ae1841d20c9f2618959,You used to be able to mod your game to do that. But Riot actually took it out. Insanity runs that company.

3110,5e385ae1841d20c9f2618965,Yeah pretty sure it was/is or used to be a thing.
3111,5e385ae1841d20c9f2618969,Riot would never take away your ability to flex your skins
3112,5e385ae2841d20c9f261896d,"I doubt they would ever do this since people pay money (up to $30) for those, and theres some skins that change animations such as Legendaries so then 2 players would see absolutely different things."

Other things such as her healing is another problem that presented because of Gunblade and Ravenoud being abusable by her and gunbalde specifically on Kat and Akali."

The argument is simply Aphelios ""needs"" more clarity for fair counterplay.

So it obviously wasn't a mandatory requirement to make the champ."

I bring this example up because High Noon Ashe uses a similar rig to  Championship Ashe.  So she has some flowing bits off her arms and shoulders that turns white either when she activates q or has it stacked.  The killer was that her run animation is the Project Ashe one so I legit saw a woman with flowing white robes and big something held behind them.  At a glance I reacted like its riven.  A longer look quickly showed it was ashe but sometimes you react to glances.

And to be honest I don't really care because it's such a narrow use case that I don't want it to remove those awesome skins."

So he has five guns, each with 50 ammo. He carries one in main hand and one in offhand. When a gun is depleted (through Q and auto-attacking), the next is swapped in so that the depleted gun can be reloaded. Each gun has its own basic attack and activation ability, none of which share cooldowns. He can freely swap (with a cast time) between his offhand and mainhand. 

Depleted guns are put at the back of the weapon queue."

My issue is most of the posts are not about clarity but are really about not understanding the kit, which I personally believe is an individual and not a design issue. People act like it’s riots fault when they walk into a calibrum sentry and lose their HP when they willing walked into it ignorantly, or when they get gravitum ulted and rooted (god forbid anyone is actually aware of what the different ults do regardless of how clear their colours are)"

Kalista is a failure period, Riot has no idea how to make that champ playable in solo queue without taking over competitive. Her pickrate is sub 1% and her winrate is around 48-49%, which is incredibly low for a high skillcap AD carry.

Now

> Darius

The current Darius rework isn't his, he had to be reworked because instant Q was incredibly oppressive.

> Zyra

Same as Darius, though to be fair she isn't much different now from the old one.

> Thresh

Sure, had to be trimmed heavily.

> Yasuo

Same as Thresh. Also one of the most hated champions in the game.

> Graves

He's a tad like Kalista, where if he's good he kind of takes over the jungle, but not as extreme. Still a pretty problematic champ.

> Warwick

He was heavily leashed during this rework, but yeah it's pretty good imo.

> Caitlyn

She was completely oppresive until they got the headshot hurricane interaction that he insisted on keeping. Now it's fine.

So it's much more of a mixed bag than people pretend it to be. I think he's a good designer but only in the sense that he usually thinks up a decent kit then has someone else clean up the mess and trim unneeded stuff. But he's had far more blunders than people like to admit.

Jury's arguably out on Aphelios but I'm leaning towards failure at all. He has a complex kit with a simple playstyle, which is the worst combination."

Kalista is unbalanceable, graves and yasuo have consistently been balance nightmares keeping adc in a very difficult to adjust position due to using the same items, zoe on release was insanely overloaded, zyra is organic heimerdinger, not to mention most of these champions are very frustrating to play *against* besides Thresh, WW, and Darius.

His whole shtick is putting wacky wild new mechanics into champs in a game where characters are deliberately kept relatively simple, they could easily have gone a different route and released 2-3 champs a year that are tekken complicated but they didnt. Sometimes the mechanic is interesting but theyre almost always bad for the game as they allow the champion to circumvent some core part of the game or favor items intended and balanced for an entirely different class of champion."
3218,5e385ae8841d20c9f2618b15,"Lol every single one of those champs has either been reworked again or has had one or more mechanics removed from their kit. 

The only real exception is Warwick, but CT didn't have full reign to ruin him like other reworks"
3219,5e385ae8841d20c9f2618b19,"If you think keeping track of 5 enemy flashes is easier than checking for the purple gun we are just going to have to go our separate ways I think. That is the only gun that really matters. All the others just come down to burst/cc. You either out-damage Aphelios through his range/lifesteal, or cc him before he ramps up his damage to kill you."
3220,5e385ae8841d20c9f2618b1d,"Has Aphelios been on free rotation? I am sure he has and I missed it, but it should be available in practice always imo."
3221,5e385ae8841d20c9f2618b21,"IMO that's the problem with him, unless you've played him a lot or have spent a lot of time reading his kit it just isn't easy to judge what he does.  You can pretty much understand every other champ based off a few games either on them or against/with them and yet even in pro play where it is their job to understand the champ you see people confused."
3222,5e385ae8841d20c9f2618b25,"What do you think? Putting bad faith discussion aside, I would imagine that if they had thought about it but not done so, or, removed a previously available possibility, there may well be reasons for that.

Have you considered why?"

3230,5e385ae8841d20c9f2618b45,Except that's a splash that kills you. Splash damage isn't the dumb part here. The dumb part is you can't tell what is about to be splashed to your teammates no matter what. Dardoch could not have known he was gonna for sure kill Kobbe with that E to safety

3360,5e385b0b841d20c9f2618d50,"that's... clearly a bug

>  they decided to remove it because it didn't match Jhin's Q tooltip perfectly

Yeah, Nunu being invisible when he's casting his snowball doesn't match his tooltip either but that doesn't mean it's a mechanic.

I do think it should stay because it adds some form of skill expression (just like Caitlyn's E+Q is a bug) but calling it a mechanic when it CLEARLY isn't is just misleading"
3361,5e385b0b841d20c9f2618d54,"So I understand that you are upset that a ""mechanic"" has been removed. It sucks to have something that you would use in a niche situation be removed from a champion you love.

If you read the description for bouncing grenade:  ""with each kill it performs increasing its total damage by 35%.""

The ""it"" the description is referring to is the grenade itself.

In this case, this is a bug fix not a mechanic removal. The additional damage is clearly not intended to apply unless the grenade is the ""it"" that is doing the last hitting."
3362,5e385b0b841d20c9f2618d58,"For those saying it’s a bug - a lot of things actually work like this, where the ability works even when its target dies before it lands. That includes stuff like Pyke ult reset. So either it’s not a bug, since Riot is allowing it on multiple things, or it is, in which case Jhin’s grenade probably shouldn’t be the priority to fix."
3363,5e385b0b841d20c9f2618d5c,"It's funny how if there was any mechanic like this on the mains of the people who want this removed from Jhin they would have opposite opinions. Plenty of champs such have mechanics like this, pyke ult, Cass e, irellia q. Just update the tool tip. What's wrong with adding extra skill ceiling to a champion."

3365,5e385b0b841d20c9f2618d64,"I believe the change to champion abilities like Sivir, Jhin, MF bounce was actually documented as a QOL change (the stuff at the bottom of patch notes usually) because I remember reading it and thinking it was awesome because I would always try and hit supports hiding in bushes as MF and it'd always just fizzle out :("

3367,5e385b0b841d20c9f2618d6c,"All these people saying “that’s a bug”, well then it should be in the patch notes. Taking a bug that is used all the time out of the game should be documented."
3368,5e385b0b841d20c9f2618d70,That just sounds like a bug. I don't think you should get the bonus damage if you don't use the ability correctly.
3369,5e385b0b841d20c9f2618d74,"Honestly, I don't mind, it makes sense, rewards you for lining up that ""perfect art"", and doesn't allow you to just hastily slap a w or auto down to fix your fuck up."

they fixed a bug."
3371,5e385b0b841d20c9f2618d7c,Why should your preference be the way to go? That part is missing from your post. And unintuitive mechanics are usually unwise

3373,5e385b0b841d20c9f2618d84,Hi taco!
3374,5e385b0b841d20c9f2618d88,I hate seeing Riot remove advanced mechanics from simple champs. It’s the only thing keeping them from getting stale for me. I dread the day they remove flash kick or something from Lee.
3375,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618d8c,"This feels like a Nerf if anything, and with a champ that's balanced great taking this out feels bad imo"
3376,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618d90,"reddit is so fucking stupid. billions of comments repeating ""ummmm it's a bug soo."" peak silver mentality. it's a small trick that increases the skillcap of an otherwise simple champion, making jhin more fun to play. that is good for the game. youre completely missing the point debating with your own smooth brain whether it's a bug or not, all that matters is whether it's fun or interesting, and it's both. just shut the fuck up"
3377,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618d94,"It got removed removed because its very clearly a bug, not a mechanic ..."
3378,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618d98,It for sure worked early this week because I used it multiple times.
3379,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618d9c,ay man you in the 910?
3380,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618da0,"I'm pretty sure this has been gone already for a while, I think it only works now when in between the bounce of two targets not after it has already been hit"
3381,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618da4,I just love how you got confused in the clip by it doesn't working :D .
3382,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618da8,"Jhin could also shoot traps out of his gun with TP bug. If you TP at the same time you 4th shot, you get permanent 4th shot. If you E while you have it, you shoot E’s. Idk if Sett change fixed that too, but I know it existed."
3383,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618dac,Hey you forgot to mention MASTERS JHIN
3384,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618db0,"Fucking love your videos man, you're the main reason I play jhin."
3385,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618db4,"This was too detailed, I had to upvote and work on ""learning"" Jhin ""again"". Thanks a bunch, bruddah"
3386,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618db8,"Even if it was a bug, I hate that it's been patched out because Q+Auto has been ingrained in my muscle memory."
3387,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618dbc,I can't believe they've removed this mechanic as I've always felt this is on the the nuances of knowing the champion
3388,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618dc0,"I love how you people still think Riot doesn't notice these things. hell if they can get away with deleting Karma and Aatrox from the game with words like ""remake"" and ""balance"" and people scream about it every day yet nothing changes.

why do you think this one is gonna work for something so minor that 99% of players don't even care about?"
3389,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618dc4,"4 years huh, feels like just yesterday.."
3390,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618dc8,"Yo, really cool that you discovered this and did a write up on it. Didn't realise it was you til I saw the clip. I didn't even know this was a thing until this, but when it (hopefully) comes back I'll know be able to use this trick.

Jhin's become my secondary ADC because of your vids and I really enjoy playing him. Obviously still learning and not high rank but I wouldn't be playing him if I didn't binge your videos."
3391,5e385b0c841d20c9f2618dcc,Also it is the year 2020. 20 plus 20 equates to 40. It is also the 10 year anniversary of LoL. 40 divided by 10 is 4. Just something to think about and look deeper into.
3392,5e385b0d841d20c9f2618dd0,I refuse to believe that Jain is 4 years old
3393,5e385b0d841d20c9f2618dd4,I always thought this was intended. Helps a lot if you’re just a small bit of damage off finishing normally with Q
3394,5e385b0d841d20c9f2618dd8,"I remember when graves was really strong back in season 7 I think, and he had this weird combo where he could cancel the pushback on his ult, and that was removed as a nerf, I don't see why jhin should get nerfed when he's not particularly overpowered, this also goes for stuff like ghost barrels on GP, I hope this is brought back."
3395,5e385b0d841d20c9f2618ddc,"Damn. Jhins been out for four years, feels like yesterday he got released"
3396,5e385b0d841d20c9f2618de0,Sometimes late in the game I can't q minions. Idk if that's a bug with jhin too

3401,5e385b0d841d20c9f2618df4,I mean they also “fixed a bug” that’s been on Lux’s E for 10 years so what do you expect

3405,5e385b0d841d20c9f2618e04,"At this point, I unconsiously just do the mechanic. I q then auto with the last shot to increase the damage all the time, and I never knew why it worked, until now."
3406,5e385b0d841d20c9f2618e08,"**4** Year old mechanic, **4** topic detailed description. Accompanied by **4** screenshots. **4** word  summoner name. Bug fixed on 10.**4**

Good content, rated **4/4.**"
3407,5e385b0d841d20c9f2618e0c,"Hmm.. 

It does say each target killed **by the cartridge** increases the damage.  


*But*

It also used to work and Riot didn't say anything about the change."
3408,5e385b0d841d20c9f2618e10,"If this is here, can I ask what's the current best core build for Jhin?"
3409,5e385b0d841d20c9f2618e14,Meanwhile Caitlyn crying in the corner not getting any love from Daddy Riot
3410,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e18,"Thanks Taco!
You are genuinely intertwining to watch, so keep up the good work!"
3411,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e1c,Interesting
3412,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e20,Aren't all of Jhin's mechanics 4 year old mechanics if he's on his 4th anniversary? Did the joke go over my forehead?
3413,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e24,"Actually, it should not increase damage unless Q actually killed the minion. If 3 minions have not died to first 3 jumps, 4th hit should receive no bonus damage. All other behavior is a bugged spaghetti."
3414,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e28,Meanwhile I’m still waiting since patch 7.11 for lee sin W smart+self cast to get fixed
3415,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e2c,"It's really frustrating to have these bug fixes change how a champion plays. This one is probably unintended, but the Lux fix is still sad to see."
3416,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e30,that sounds like a really dumb interactions anyway...
3417,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e34,"At the same time, I continue to annoyed by hidden champion features like this. Would it kill Riot to properly document the game in the game itself? It feels like to truly understand any champion the only real way is to go to third party sites, which just shouldn't be the case in a competitive game."
3418,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e38,"Didn't even know it existed, damn"
3419,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e3c,"1- you're the man Taco 
2- I really liked the fact that if I miscalculate my q dmg I could quickly auto a minion that lived with 1 hp to save the rest of my cs instead of missing all of them  while I reload.   Hope they change it back"
3420,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e40,"Felt it in my game today too and I thought I was crazy. This combo is literally a staple for his poke game. Taking it away feels like an unnecessary giga nerf and it's so sad to see this. Really hope they put it back. Thanks for bringing it up, Taco."
3421,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e44,People saying it sounds like a bug when people like Riven abuse bugs every game.
3422,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e48,"Tbh, I also have been playing Jhin since his release yet I never really noticed this as being a bug as much as it has become a mechanic.

It’s not like it’s a very hard move to pull off. Most people who play Jhin have probably done this even accidentally.

There’s no way in FOUR years of playing against Jhins y’all have never noticed this. You weren’t complaining then, why complain now?"
3423,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e4c,"People keep calling this a bug.  Why is it a bug?  because it doesn't match *exactly* what the tooltip says?  

That would make

Diana's E refreshing after Q outright kills the target

Xayah E recalling Q blades that haven't landed yet

Yasuo W granting vision

Ashe's Q allowing movement instantly after AAs (no lockup while the arrows are in the air)

Ashe gaining assists if her E blows up on someone who hadn't been seen before it blew up (if they get killed right after)

Mundo not being able to kill himself with his Q

Cho gaining a mark on champions when his R will execute

Darius's R not eating mana/going on CD if it's interupted during the windup

Kassadin W (the active) not affecting towers/Structures

And hundreds of other like them all bugs.  

Jhin's Q dealing bonus damage even if the Q isn't the attack to kill it is just an interaction, one piece of code interacting with the rest of the game.  Whether or not it's a bug is up to the developers, and judging based on *very* imperfect tooltips is probably not the best measure."
3424,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e50,I read this entire post in your voice lol
3425,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e54,"Honestly as much as I see people praising this am I the only one that thinks this should STAY this way? 

I know the classic ""well not all tooltips are accurate"" but this tooltip is pretty simple, short, and straight forward and EVERYONE knows this ability in this way. 

This let's you cheat out extra damage that no one is going to expect because riot told them not to, so I think it was a big that was fixed. Not a removed mechanic."
3426,5e385b0e841d20c9f2618e58,"Active: Jhin launches a cartridge at the targeted enemy that deals physical damage before bouncing to a nearby target that has not yet been hit. 

The cartridge can hit a maximum of 4 times. **Each kill by the cartridge** increases the damage of subsequent hits by 35%."
3427,5e385b0f841d20c9f2618e5c,"Hey Taco, you are one of my favorite League players I watch, and I don't even play the game anymore! I just highly enjoy watching you play Jhin (My favorite marksman)."

3431,5e385b0f841d20c9f2618e6c,I don't know anything about League and thought this was an article about a 4-year old boy named Jhin who worked on cars.

3434,5e385b0f841d20c9f2618e78,I hope they bring it back. I liked that mechanic.
3435,5e385b0f841d20c9f2618e7c,"""ACTIVE: Jhin launches a canister at the target enemy, dealing physical damage. Dancing Grenade bounces to up to three additional enemies beyond the first, with each kill it performs increasing its total damage by 35%.""

Why are all so sure it's a bug?  Based on the tooltip the reason it has to die before the bounce is just so the damage can apply.  As long as they die before the FINAL bounce it should be fine"
3436,5e385b0f841d20c9f2618e80,"To everyone saying ""it's not a mechanic, it's a bug""... How do you know *the tooltip* is not the bug?"
3437,5e385b0f841d20c9f2618e84,A bug is a bug and it's good when it's fixed.
3438,5e385b0f841d20c9f2618e88,"I have mixed feelings about it because this “mechanic” is very obviously a bug, but on the other hand champions like Irelia get to recieve the gold and cooldown reset for her dash even if she hits a minion with it too late (after it has already died to something else) so it doesn’t seem quite as ludicrous by comparison..."
3439,5e385b0f841d20c9f2618e8c,"upvote for the work but because its a bug so its normal its removed, so no vote"
3440,5e385b0f841d20c9f2618e90,"I'm sorry, is everyone smoking something? 

You bounce a grenade, it doesn't kill anything, it does less damage. That's the point"
3441,5e385b0f841d20c9f2618e94,I don't think this is a mechanic of his kit. It shouldn't have worked like that even if it stayed for 4 years.

Mmh, yes, the 4 year old here is made our of four years"
3445,5e385b10841d20c9f2618ea4,I thought it only gives bonus damage if you kill things with the Q itself

3453,5e385b10841d20c9f2618ec4,This is a bug and shouldn't be fixed
3454,5e385b10841d20c9f2618ec8,Honestly this sounds like a bug and it should not work like that considering what the tooltip says. It should definitely stay fixed even if Jhin mains are gonna mald over it
3455,5e385b10841d20c9f2618ecc,"Good informative post but your suggestion is stupid, Why put back an unintended feature into the game? It's illogical and has no clarity for both player and enemy.(they can't know this mechanic works like this unless they check it for themselves in practice tool). Leave this out of the game.

I like how you say that removing an unintended mechanic is a bug. A bug is by definition unintended so i guess they unintentionally removed something unintended? What?"
3456,5e385b10841d20c9f2618ed0,"sounds more like a bug than a ""mechanic"""
3457,5e385b10841d20c9f2618ed4,This is kind of like the caitlyn mechanic that got removed. If they bring this jhin mechanic back they better bring the caitlyn one too

3459,5e385b10841d20c9f2618edc,"Hmm.. well it seems like the “mechanic” may have been a bug, but of course it wasn’t game breaking or anything and didn’t make the champion worse of unplayable, so maybe Riot found an opportunity to fix it without causing many other problems with Jhin and simply did so.

3466,5e385b11841d20c9f2618ef8,"Nah this is a bug , an unintended mechanic which isnt clear for the ones playing against the champion , now I know why Jhin's Q even though not killing minions suddenly takes out half of your hp without reason , thats not a mechanic , is a bug which has to be taken out. It has no sense at all , it doesn't need to be written it need to be out of the game. This type of petitions are part of the problem with the awful balanced and buggy game league is."
3467,5e385b11841d20c9f2618efc,"Hey, Penguin! Thank you so much! I know it's not mentioned in the tooltip, but a lot of champions have interactions like this not in the tooltip. This felt more of removal due to fixing the trap bug from earlier.

3469,5e385b11841d20c9f2618f04,"Thanks for reading this! It’s nice to see rito employees feedback on even the most obscure mechanics like this. I play Jhin frequently and I never knew this existed, but I would love to do this in game."

3472,5e385b11841d20c9f2618f10,This is wonderful news. Thank you.
3473,5e385b11841d20c9f2618f14,"How exactly is this a bug? The full description reads: Jhin launches a canister at the target enemy, dealing physical damage. Dancing Grenade bounces to up to three additional enemies beyond the first, with each kill **it performs** increasing its total damage by 35%. If the grenade isn't killing them, it shouldn't be doing extra damage."
3474,5e385b11841d20c9f2618f18,"I think this mechanic should not be reverted. If I understood it correctly, then this allows the Q to get additional damage while the previous targets get killed **after** the Q bounced on them. That is a little misleading and I don't think that's how the Q should work either."
3475,5e385b11841d20c9f2618f1c,"I mean, it sounds like a bug to begin with. It’s supposed to be that if the Grenade kills the target, it increases the damage. “With each kill it performs increasing the damage”, “and gain damage each time it kills.” (Quotes from the wiki and the official league website respectively) - it does not say “when a target it damaged dies within x time.” 

I don’t think it’s very fair that you can expect it to do x amount of damage but then it does a boatload more because Jhin used w just in time to change it. I think it should be immediately obvious what the damage will be. The grenade will become a complete zoning tool if he has the power to make it full power whenever just because he holds W to finish off the caster line."
3476,5e385b11841d20c9f2618f20,Why fix it? It's a bug lol.
3477,5e385b12841d20c9f2618f24,My suggestion is that you keep the bug fixed because you shouldn't pander to mains that will obviously want the most benefitial option even if it's a stupid one.

A lot of us are super distraught by this because it’s been in the game for years. Yesterday I threw a Lux e in a bush, it did not reveal the enemy, but after the enemy walked out of the bush it showed my massive has proc’d. Which meant my e did indeed hit the enemy while in the bush but did not reveal that they were in there. https://youtu.be/awvML7Pqcqc This video explains the situation further. I’m not sure if it’s possible but I speak for a lot of lux mains, could this be investigated once more?

Thank you very much. ❤️"

Also as the bugfix in the patch note describes, the bonus attack after double headshot canceling was removed (Which sounded like a bug anyway as it didnt even stack rageblade), But was it necessary to remove her ability to headshot during E? I don't think so. It was a pretty neat thing for caitlyn to have.

And all of these remain undocumented."

Not the same. The Pyke ult reset is intended and explained in the tooltip – it says ""if the target dies inside the ult"" rather than ""if Pyke kills it with the ult""."
3530,5e385b15841d20c9f2618ff8,"Yeah, it gets more obvious once you realize that plenty of those ""reset on kill"" abilities proc if the minion dies before being hit by the ability too, as long as the ability has already been cast.

It's less of a bug and more of a feature meant to make gameplay smoother. Iirc irelia has it in her q, where if the minion dies while she's mid dash towards it, it'll reset her q still. That way you don't randomly lose your q because your teammate killed the minion it something.

If people want to talk about bs mechanics, for jhin, his root laser sometimes bends and now that's real bs. But his q? I highly doubt that's a problem."
3531,5e385b15841d20c9f2618ffc,"The problem is, that this is some other kind of ""on kill""-effect.

The ability says ""with each kill it performs increasing its total damage by 35%."". I could understand that if you cast the grenade on a minion that dies while casting, that it counts for the damage or you get the mana back and the ability has no cooldown, but giving the extra damage even when it (the grenade) doesn't kill the target, is straight up a bug."

>one of the very few ways to express skill and knowledge of the champ

I mean you could just play the champ really well. There are assloads of champions that don't have a little tick like this, it's preposterous to say that the people that main those champs are less than people that main other champs. You don't need to have flash to have substance and you shouldnt play the game around how you perceive others perceiving your gameplay.

I don't buy that idea at all, it's neat but it's far from a mad style play or something that's difficult, the trick is knowing that this mechanic exists CONTRARY  to the tooltip, that's not a good way to do that.

All that being said they can just as easily change the tooltip as fix the bug, Jhin isn't exactly a problem child atm.

Edit: The tooltip isn't ""misleading"", it's incorrect. You can like the mechanic and think it has merit but again, that just means it needs to actually read what it does, that's all. Flashy mechanics are fine but we don't need hidden mechanics, shits crazy as it is. The exact specifics of this or any ability are irrelevant, tooltips should NEVER lie that's all I meant, as it is this has lied the last 4 years and that's an issue that needs to be addressed regardless. 

And again, I think it's fine, it's a cool niche move."

Should Riot fix the wording due to the grace period of Q to be more clear? Yep. But the overreaction about how this mechanic is broken, despite being implemented on many other champions for smooth gameplay, is a little extreme.

Honestly, fix the wording/change the description. It is pretty much a essential trick for all Jhin players that isn't close to broken and then people can stop complaining.

This is not the same at all. Jhin Q has already hit the minion and missed. Then you kill the minion and that somehow retroactively increases the damage of the Q on the next target.

A similar case would be you killing the minion the Q is bouncing to **before** the Q lands on it, not afterwards. There is no other _intended_ interaction that I know of that is comparable to this bug."

Why is this advanced mechanic, and the act of having a grace period bad for the game? Darius ult has a grace period on it's refresh. Other champion abilities have grace periods, like Diana's E resetting even if the target dies before her Q hits it. In fact, this was actually FIXED to be this way when they reworked Diana, so it's not even an old mechanic.

I don't understand why some champions are allowed to have these grace periods but Jhin isn't?

You're against Jhin having one advanced mechanic in his whole kit, versus them just releasing Aphelios? Senna?

Caitlyn can E>Q and change the visual of the Q hitbox/cancel the Q animation almost altogether and Jhin being able to affect his Q's bounce damage within .5 of a second is somehow too much?"

3649,5e385b1c841d20c9f26191d4,Imagine Ali not being able to pull off this combo. He would be completely useless.
3650,5e385b1c841d20c9f26191d8,"The tooltip is misleading, yes, but that it not what makes it an expression of skill. My first an least compelling argument is that not everyone reads tooltips since some of them, not just this one, are either misleading, unclear, or outdated. I, for example, instead look at recent guides if I want to learn about a champion's abilities. (This does not mean that the tooltip shouldn't be updated, it should! It just means that many players do not rely on the tooltips to learn about a champion's abilities, but instead rely on their experience or third-parties, which is why I don't believe that the skill required to pull off Q-auto is not primarily about knowing that the tooltip being wrong.)

Even if the tooltip was changed to something like ""Bouncing Grenade deals bonus damage every time a target dies before the subsequent target is hit"", the majority of non-mains would not use this mechanic. It takes a few games to know when your Q is going to deal enough damage so that the minion will only be one auto away from death thus allowing this Q+auto combo to be done. It takes a bit of practice, and someone who only plays the champ once in a while won't always think of doing it even if it is mentioned in the tooltip. Ahri Q gives bonus movespeed according to tooltip, but non-mains will very rarely use Q for the movespeed, while mains will use it if the situation calls for it. 

Even if the tooltip is changed (which it should be), there are still opposing players which are not going to expect the bonus damage from a bouncing grenade that isn't going to kill the casters on its own, the same way that some players don't always predict that a minion will be bursted by the carry when a Blitz throws his Q at a half hp minion standing in front of that player.

I think you misunderstood my point about differentiating mains from casuals. It's not about wanting to look good to others, it's about feeling like I'm good. Even if it's not the flashiest thing in the world, it's FUN and makes me feel like I'm good at my champion. Even if I'm not actually that good, isn't having fun the whole point? Pulling off a flashy mechanic that not everyone uses feels good, no matter the champion. It feels good to flash over the big ass toplane wall then see the champion chasing you fail miserably. It feels good to pull off the shy Riven combo, knowing that not everyone can do it. It feels good to start to channel R right before a stun or a knockup as Ezreal to maximize your DPS. Hell, it felt good to quickscope people back when I played CoD with my friends on Xbox Live. I'm not a streamer or a pro player, no one is ever going to watch me land some mildly cool lvl 3 poke in botlane. It's not about how I look to other people, it's about me and the other Jhin mains out there who enjoy doing it.

As you said, I don't think Jhin is problematic right now, and this bug/mechanic has never been something people saw as unfair, despite it being well-known. I don't believe for one second that Riot never knew about this, this is a very well-known combo on Jhin that most mains either figured out on their own, or heard about through guides, streams or talking to other mains in communities such as /r/JhinMains . It feels weird to have it taken away without a mention, which is why we believe it is an accident and should be reversed, since it was a fun part of the game for us Jhin Mains (and the tooltip should be updated)."
3651,5e385b1c841d20c9f26191dc,"I consider surprising my enemy with unexpected burst meaningful skill expression. It's not missing if it's done on purpose. Every bot laner and their mother knows to stay away from a 1/10 HP caster minion against Jhin, not everyone knows that Jhin is able to hurt you even if the minion's HP is higher. The fact is that this is a well-known interaction that no one has ever complained about, and while it is not the flashiest thing, it's one of the very few ways Jhin mains can outplay their opponents who don't expect you to use Q BEFORE autoing the minion, yet still have the extra burst, because you knew that your Q would make the minion have low enough HP to be killed of by a single auto before the grenade hits the champion.

This may come as a surprise to someone I assume to be an Akali main, but you don't need 10 dashes and invisibility to be able to express skill. There are more subtle ways to outplay opponents, that doesn't mean that they don't feel good to the players performing them or that they should be removed from the game because they don't require you to press twelve keys in 0.1 sec in a specific order."

this ones directly documented on the skill, and also very clear in that you see the extra gold and you see that he has the ult reset. Theres nothing about the grenade indicating that its damage wouldve increased, and theres nothing on the tooltip that tells this.

*Bladesurge's Cooldown reduction icon cooldown is refunded if the target was marked or if it dies to or after Bladesurge has been cast*

also clear. Also the opponent isnt paying attention to the fact that the minion dies slightly before the ire Q/cass E hits, but instead sees that the minion will die to it once it hits, and therefore can figure out that they'll get the reset. With jhin nade, you can see the grenade not kill, and then would logically assume that jhin missed that extra damage.

3676,5e385b1e841d20c9f2619240,"I agree that the wording should change if they bring it back. When a mechanic is in the game for such a long time, whether it was a bug at first or not, it makes more sense to change the tooltip than the ability IMO. ""The damage of bouncing grenade gets greater every time a target dies before the subsequent target is hit"" or something like that would be better IMO."
3677,5e385b1e841d20c9f2619244,"Theres also no other reset/buff mechanic based on hitting/killing multiple targets though

At least, none that I can think of"
3678,5e385b1e841d20c9f2619248,And Caitlyn's machine gun combo was a 'bug' and they removed it. So...
3679,5e385b1e841d20c9f261924c,"At least Riven's cancels add to her skill, rather than remove from it. And even then I think it was pretty lame of RIOT to let a bug stay because they can't solve it."
3680,5e385b1e841d20c9f2619250,"> Other champion abilities have grace periods, like Diana's E resetting even if the target dies before her Q hits it. 

That's not a grace period. That's the target dying before the E hits, not afterwards. A valid comparison would be Diana missing her E, but then landing a Q half a second later and that somehow refreshing her E retroactively. It would be stupid and counterintuitive.

If Jhin launches a Q that kills nothing and bounces towards me, why should I suddenly take 105% increased damage because 0.2 seconds before the Q hits me, the enemy Jhin killed off the three minions he missed? Not only he was not punished for failing his Q, but instead I was punished for being good enough to realize that Q didn't pose a threat. If I should get away from his Q 'just in case' even when he misses, what's the point of the increase anymore? Just make it deal 105% damage to me at all times."
3681,5e385b1e841d20c9f2619254,"Don’t forget pyke, he he’s full ult benefits and reset even if the target dies before the ult damage hits"
3682,5e385b1e841d20c9f2619258,"because if you kill the 3rd target after the Q bounces you recieve THE WHOLE DAMAGE BONUS as if all 3 targets died from the bounce,  it has nothing to do with a grace period,  that's just an ability not working as described.

Edit: misread op about the Q bounce and how he applied the full damage"
3683,5e385b1e841d20c9f261925c,He's simple in the sense that you can pretty clearly see what he does and there aren't really any mechanical tricks like animation cancels or unique combos.
3684,5e385b1e841d20c9f2619260,"Jhin’s passive really isn’t that “complicated”. The math behind it is, for sure, but the concept really isn’t. Fixed attack speed, compensated for by adjusted stats from items, powerful 4th auto. That’s basically it."
3685,5e385b1e841d20c9f2619264,Many words doesn't mean hard to play.
3686,5e385b1e841d20c9f2619268,"If I'm playing against Jhin and his grenade kills 3 minions and then bounce to me I know that its going to do max damage. If I see it bounce 3 times, not kill anything and then do max damage to me, I'm going to think its a bug. It's just not obvious. The fact that he has to explain this 4 year old mechanic is evidence enough."

3688,5e385b1e841d20c9f2619270,"They are. You see Jhin's Q miss everything then suddenly it takes half your life away. It makes no fucking sense unless you know there's a bug that allows Jhin to kill off a minion that was already hit by Q and retroactively increase the damage of that Q.

That shit is far less intuitive than anything Aphelios can do."
3689,5e385b1e841d20c9f2619274,"Since you lack a fucking brain let me explain it 

you use the q to last hit caster minions it increases damage tada it does what it says.

I personally think this interaction is worth supporting but will consult with SR designers + August. Either way a definitive stance on the mechanic is better than tribal knowledge."

3721,5e385b20841d20c9f26192f4,"Yeah but you surprise him not bc you are better but bc sth. is bugged and he doesn´t know the bug, by that logic the blade abuse to 1shot ppl etc all is a skill expression"
3722,5e385b20841d20c9f26192f8,Literally the main point of my comment was that the tooltips are not always accurate of intention. Tons of times they have known about it for ages and dont bother changing the tooltip until way later on like with the mana refund on cass's e still giving mana even if the creep dies while it is midair.
3723,5e385b20841d20c9f26192fc,"what a shit argument. ""a is good b is bad when they fix the bug""

bullshit

i bet 99% didnt even know it existed yet alone did those 1% use the bug effectively. it's just a burst of damage unsuspected by the enemy due to the known mechanic that it has to kill the minions to increase the damage. no clarity, not intended, almost unused. bugfix and watch the winrate drop 0.01%. wow. much incredible."
3724,5e385b20841d20c9f2619300,Isn't caitlyns winrate something like 48-49% in all elos?

It's not interesting. In fact is less interesting than lining up minions so your bounce kills them all."

3737,5e385b21841d20c9f2619334,"It isn't comparable. League's tooltips are wildly inconsistent and trashy, but generally you can't block turret damage so it's intuitive. Even if you have a problem, if you ever get hit by a turret while in W, you can pretty easily tell what happened, and as it's the norm you can expect it. The same can't be said for Jhin's Q. You don't expect killing minions will retroactively increase the damage of the Q, and you can't realistically realizel that your Q did 520 damage instead of 450 because you killed a minion that was hit by Q before while the Q was still flying to its final target."
3738,5e385b21841d20c9f2619338,It explicitly doesn't block turret shots
3739,5e385b21841d20c9f261933c,I like how jarvans tooltip for ult says it creates an area of unpassable terrain but everyone who has a dash can dash through it lol. Been that way forever
3740,5e385b21841d20c9f2619340,"I mean most bugs/features at least don´t state the exact opposite in their tooltip, i think."
3741,5e385b21841d20c9f2619344,"Difference is that how easy it is to see that it is a bug and in theory the nunu bug exists and only literally person knows it and for the rest it is random (unlikely but possible), we could just make cassios E deal extra dmg as long as the person is poisoned 1-3secs later..."

then what the fuck are you even arguing about jesus fucking christ"
3743,5e385b22841d20c9f261934c,It boils down to the balance of the mechanics in question
3744,5e385b22841d20c9f2619350,"Also Lux got straight up nerfed from the last """"bug"""" that they fixed which makes her E not reveal bushes unless the hitbox actively touches them. It was there for 9 years, it's a goddamn feature at that point"
3745,5e385b22841d20c9f2619354,"That is literally what I said happens with Diana. She will throw Q and then E, and land with E before Q lands and retroactively refresh her E. This happens on both living and dead targets as far as I was able to confirm on practice tool. In fact this goes further and if she Q>E's quick enough, later targets hit by the Q still gain moonlight even though E is supposed to eat Moonlight stacks. This is even more drastic than just a grace period mechanic. She is rewarded with a whole extra reset just by being quick fingered.

 * Kalista E has a grace period on her rend where auto's and Q's in flight will be used to Rend even if Kalista casts E before those spears have hit their target. The damage becomes much burstier when she doesn't have to delay her E until these spears land. Retroactively applies more damage.
 * Ezreal passive has a slight grace period where his passive stacks will refresh to maximum value if they drop right as his spell hits. Sounds like a small deal but his passive is like 50% attack speed. A huge bonus throughout the entire game. Retroactively refreshes a buff that was supposed to have dropped.
 * Rengar's Grace Period is listed but he is able to jump after leaving brush. How is that fair for you as the enemy? You played the range right but based on his movespeed he can jump on you anyway.
 * Darius R exists with a grace period too. Is it fair that if he fails to kill the target with R he gets the reset just because they died in 0.25 seconds?

I was writing up a list of champions with similar mechanics before this and testing them because I was genuinely curious. There are plenty of champions with grace periods.

You are looking at this from a perspective of the enemy, but it turns out that it's more important for spells to feel impactful for the player using them and not about how it feels for the enemy (Riot has confirmed this is core to their design theory before and is why Lollypopping is prevalent on skillshots, especially hooks). Jhin's ability to buffer the damage on his Q using the grace period (maybe it could be argued to be a bit strong, but Jhin isn't even broken to begin with and removing this mechanic will drastically hurt Jhin mains) isn't some out there super absurd thing.

Why is it important to shadow nerf a very important mechanic for Jhin players when he's a 50% winrate champ? Even if he was 53-54%, why would we remove this rather simple mechanic instead of directly nerfing whatever numbers are making him OP to begin with?

Now, add it to his toolkit description sure. I can't argue against it being added, but removing the mechanic is downright wrong and stupid."
3746,5e385b22841d20c9f2619358,"I actually never knew this until I played a few games on him, there were so many moments I was about to rage for someone taking a kill in my R until I noticed it still counted"
3747,5e385b22841d20c9f261935c,"That's exactly what his tooltip says. And the targets die _before_, not _afterwards_. A proper comparison would be Pyke missing R, and a second later finishing his target with E + Q, and somehow getting a reset on his ult that was already on cd."
3748,5e385b22841d20c9f2619360,"That is not correct, all targets must die before the last bounce hits in order to get the full damage."
3749,5e385b22841d20c9f2619364,Um no? You have to kill all three targets to get the full increased damage.
3750,5e385b22841d20c9f2619368,"You had to kill all 3 targets for all 3 targets to apply the damage bonus. You couldn't just kill the 3rd one and get full damage bonus after the first 2 don't die. This is only possible by either using another full mana cost ability (like W), or very rarely in a teamfight. It's a mechanic that the Jhin player actively has to search for and should be rewarded as such. It's very hard to pull off this mechanic if the opposing player has even a modicum of knowledge of Jhin's kit.

It's not like the Q bounce has champion prioritization either.

Unless I'm reading your comment wrong, but that's what I thought you were saying.

In a lot of cases those 3 minion bounces occur so quickly it's impossible to kill them in time unless you choreograph the play by auto attacking the minion first or something."
3751,5e385b22841d20c9f261936c,"Yes, Jhin has good visual clarity.  
But his kit is not as simple as most other ADCs due to the unique scaling and the reload mechanic."

3757,5e385b22841d20c9f2619384,"I'm keen to support this mechanic - after all champions like Irelia have a tiny window where if her target dies just before she reaches them or is a few hp from death after the dash, she still gets a reset.

So I think it's fair for this one to stay, especially since this one is within Jhin's control as opposed to the Irelia case."
3758,5e385b22841d20c9f2619388,"I wrote this a few times in this thread as a reply to people who argued it shouldn't come back since it was probably a bug, but I'll write it here again with the hope that you or another Rioter sees this and consider this argument (or consider passing my point along to Rioters who decide about this stuff, as I am sure most Jhin mains will agree with this point): 

Riven animation cancelling was also a bug at first, but it eventually became a feature around which her kits and stats are balanced. If this one stayed for four years, it's normal for us mains to argue it became a feature of the champ and be upset that one of the very few ways to express skill and knowledge of the champ, differentiating a main from a casual, is being removed from the game, especially if there was not an intention to nerf Jhin."

They could very easily make the grenade fizzle out if the target dies before it hits it, but I assume they made it not work that way in order to give Jhin a ""player satisfaction"" boost.

3779,5e385b24841d20c9f26193dc,"And my point is that it definitively IS a bug. Riot can ignore any issue it wants and very well may simply update the tool tip to Each Target Killed instead of by the cartridge.

Until they DO it IS a bug. Regardless of Riots track record. 

I just think it's fair to make it work the way it is written. Even if the community likes it different way."

B) is bad so fixing a bug that makes him stronger pushes him away from becoming more balanced so compensation buffs should apply

And no the bug was super important during laning phase, it gets used for lane harass all the time"

You never autoed and killed a minion you grenaded and saw the damage go up? Do you people even play the game?"
3784,5e385b24841d20c9f26193f0,"No, you still have to kill all 3 other minions by some means before the grenade lands the final time, not just the very last minion.

Kind of tricky to pull off."
3785,5e385b24841d20c9f26193f4,"Read OP again. Very clearly says that if you killed 3 creeps that had the nade, the 4th bounce does full damage."

3787,5e385b24841d20c9f26193fc,"The E-W combo for example is nowhere in the tooltip. And iirc a similar combo works with the Q. In case you didn't know, you can cast E and instantly hit W to have your shadow dash out and copy your spell with a .x second delay (whatever the traveltime of the shadow is). Not necessarily a BROKEN mechanic by itself, but I've used it - as a non main mind you - to some avail in almost every game I played. Partially probably because that interaction is nowhere in his kit."
3788,5e385b24841d20c9f2619400,not according to the tooltip
3789,5e385b24841d20c9f2619404,"You’re clearly not smart enough to realize that Nunu’s bug is completely different. One of them is a game breaking random bug, the other bug is not random and not game breaking and has been morphed into a mechanic."
3790,5e385b24841d20c9f2619408,Exactly. Getting headshotted 15 times with no counterplay is not balanced.
3791,5e385b24841d20c9f261940c,"so yeah, fucking up a Q bounce, and killing the previous targets to fix it, alongside the fact of if you don't play jhin, or haven't seen this post, you assuming this is impossible, doesn't seem very skilled."

3801,5e385b25841d20c9f2619434,"Uh.

Irelia gets her reset if the target dies before she arrives, because her tooltip says so.

But even if you are 1 HP off from killing your target, you don't get a reset at all."
3802,5e385b25841d20c9f2619438,"A window if the target dies _before_ Q is completed, not _afterwards_. It wouldn't make sense to miss Q and then aa the minion and have Q reset. Why should this be the case with Jhin?"
3803,5e385b25841d20c9f261943c,"“Jihn mains are used to it” is one of the shittiest excuses to keep what might be a bug in place. If they change it, learn how he plays now or play someone else. No one cares that “I’m used to it this way so it should never change”."
3804,5e385b25841d20c9f2619440,Because not all tricks are the same?

3807,5e385b25841d20c9f261944c,"Snowball effect. The enemy jungler came and killed me before I could finish it, and since that death I couldn't do anything to stop him."
3808,5e385b25841d20c9f2619450,They should make it so that scuttle's shadow dash considers you aggroed as it uses it to the opposite direction of where you are.
3809,5e385b25841d20c9f2619454,"Oh, I see. I doubt it will, because it's a fairly miniscule mechanic that'd probably only be used in laning phase."
3810,5e385b25841d20c9f2619458,"She's supposed to, but it only actually resets half the time (unless she kills the unit)."
3811,5e385b26841d20c9f261945c,You are right I must be Iron if I can't notice that my Q did 60 extra damage and instantly assume it was because I killed a minion the Q had already hit was later killed by me.

3813,5e385b26841d20c9f2619464,"IIRC Q-W was removed a while ago. You might be talking about the W-E/Q buffer not E-W (press W then E/Q as quickly as possible and your E/Q comes out right when your shadow does). 
Although I do agree that that mechanic should be elaborated."
3814,5e385b26841d20c9f2619468," Then switch the nunu bug to any other random 100% reproducible bug that exists in the game

3815,5e385b26841d20c9f261946c,Exactly. Getting hit by a grenade with a 105% bonus damage with no counterplay is not balanced.

3819,5e385b26841d20c9f261947c,"How about Diana? I think before her mini-rework, if a target died after applying Q and while in dash (before she reaches the target), she wouldn't get the reset, but after the rework she still gets the reset. That's also an undocumented nuance to her kit."
3820,5e385b26841d20c9f2619480,"The thing is, the reset worked that way with old irelia aswell but iirc the tool tip didn't mention it"

3834,5e385b27841d20c9f26194b8,"Miss fortune as well, iirc, does not get double up bonus dmg on second target if the first target is not killed by Q (regardless of if it dies before or after the Q hits it)"
3835,5e385b27841d20c9f26194bc,"Yup, that's true. In fact, if you cast R on a close target while your Q projectile is still travelling, your Q will continue to mark targets while only the targets that were already hit by Q beforehand would lose the mark. So you could cast R twice in one Q. This was also not possible before the mini-rework."
3836,5e385b27841d20c9f26194c0,"I'm talking about Irelia, not Jhin."
3837,5e385b27841d20c9f26194c4,Show me an example of a riven getting her entire combo in less than a second.
3838,5e385b27841d20c9f26194c8,Why? 0.25 seconds before the grenade was going to hit me it killed nothing.
3839,5e385b27841d20c9f26194cc,"and not getting cait trapped as well. The point is if I'm going to move forward because Jhin grenade did kill nothing in 3 bounces and, for example, I need to go in to last hit or something it's not fair that what I expected to be a small hit suddenly does more than double the expected damage."

Meanwhile as Cho if you ult even a minion at the wrong timing it can waste the CD without giving you the stack.."
3842,5e385b27841d20c9f26194d8,Pyke- R still resets and gives you gold if you cast it and the enemy doesnt dies in the meantime. Cho- his passive does not restore hp/mana if enemies die after you cast your abilities
3843,5e385b27841d20c9f26194dc,Clarifying why it might make sense for irelia but not Jhin. Haven't played irelia since before her rework and not much then sorry.

3848,5e385b28841d20c9f26194f0,"That makes sense since Cho's ability is a point and click almost instant ability, while Pyke's is a delayed aoe skillshot.

3852,5e385b28841d20c9f2619500,It's not a mechanic when the description of how the ability works is just incorrect.
3853,5e385b28841d20c9f2619504,"Pyke's 0.75 and Cho is 0.25

The thing is that as ChoGath you're often struggling to close the gap so spamming R while walking and being slowed/bodyblocked/rooted is a scenario that happens every game. In thoses cases with input lag and buffering the difference isn't huge compared to Pyke 

Plus imagine having both Cho'gath and Pyke in the team. Both their ults trigger at roughly the same threshold depending on how fed each one is. Or ultra late game one fat critical strike from an ADC, a Veigar ult..."
3854,5e385b28841d20c9f2619508,Yes it can? You can ult someone and if they die during the cats time then you don't get the stack and it goes on cooldown. It can happen just like it can happen on Pyke but Pyke is the only one with a mechanic to still get the reward.

Contrary to what a lot of people think, under most circumstances Nami is pretty bad at initiating on her own, unless she’s comboing as a secondary initiator, her ult will probably do very little. It’s why when you actually do land it, the slow is pretty nasty.  
There is an argument that Nami should never actually be good at initiating since Nami’s thing is doing everything and being the most versatile support, but not excelling in any particular area.  
But either way as it stands, her ult is to disengage, make her bubble much easier to land on a diver, or to follow up on someone else’s engage.

3894,5e385b2b841d20c9f26195a9,"Lol I'll have what you are smoking, according to op.gg she has the second highest winrate of all champions over the last month with 600k games played."
3895,5e385b2b841d20c9f26195ad,"This is the thing that makes me laugh, the game is designed entirely for pro play but yet if someone makes a comment acknowledging that he gets downvoted.  
Look she is weak, favorites picks rn are engage support and enchanters are weak against that. 
End of the story."
3896,5e385b2b841d20c9f26195b1,Okay but 99% of players will never play a pro game in their life so why does a champion's relevance in pro play automatically decide how strong they are?
3897,5e385b2c841d20c9f26195b5,"I will say it one more time, the game is designed for pro play even if you can't or want  play in a tournament. The game will and will always be designed for team play. That means that everything they do in this game will be team VS team oriented.
Oh I guess that soraka top bein broken for a long time will not receive a nerf, they will proly not nerf it, naaaaah they will not nerf it. Oups they are nerfing it because of pro play"
3898,5e385b2c841d20c9f26195b9,"This is not at all true. Champions are balanced around where they are strongest. Sure, some high skillcap, team-oriented champions such as Azir or Kallista are balanced around pro play, but that is because that is where those champs are most effective. But easy champions are balanced around lower tiers. When was the last time you saw a master yi in a pro game? never. How often do you see master yi in silver soloq? All the fucking time. Please stop spouting nonsense"

3949,5e385b30841d20c9f2619686,Two or three bad games at worlds and people start acting like Faker wasn’t one of the best mids in the world last year. Only player on SKT who was more consistent was Clid.
3950,5e385b30841d20c9f261968a,"That's a joke ... ? When Faker is in form, Khan is inting. When Khan is in form, someone else is inting. Don't say ""only Faker wasn't good enough"". They all had bad games ...

Remember MSI, where Faker was hard carrying with Sylas agaisnt G2, while Khan was getting picked off non-stop, even Teddy wasn't consistent during MSI (understandable because it was his first International event). But rejecting the fault only on Faker is dumb tho. Look at the whole year.

Faker was struggled in World Semi's tho. No one can deny that, but Faker wasn't the issues of the squad. TBH no one was an issue, they just couldn't adapt to G2 style quick enough. They ended up Top 4 worlds, the squad did insanely good."
3951,5e385b30841d20c9f261968e,"Khan had some questionable moments and so did Effort and Mata, but compared to the amazing play of Teddy and Clid yeah Faker wasn't great."

Yet again, it is a chest and you should know what you are trading for, though it's painful to get an emote from it."

3965,5e385b32841d20c9f26196c7,"The point of gemstones is to entice you into spending money on a 10 gemstone skin. If they give great rewards for 1 gemstone less people are going to spend time/money on getting 10 gemstones. Riot still has to make money, but I think people forget this too easily."
3966,5e385b33841d20c9f26196cb,Thats why you dont open chests with gemstones. Im still sitting on 40 from collecting them through these years
3967,5e385b33841d20c9f26196cf,can't you reroll emotes for free though? It should then give you another emote permanent.
3968,5e385b33841d20c9f26196d3,"this is what we get when people didn't complain about them earlier. emotes are the second worst non-content pieces of crap to be added to league

the first are prestige skins."
3969,5e385b33841d20c9f26196d7,Who uses gemstones for masterwork chests?
3970,5e385b33841d20c9f26196db,"Eh gemstones honestly aren’t that hard to get anymore with the way passes work. The pass gives 4 orbs that have increased gemstone chance on purchase alone, and then you get 2 guaranteed.

3971,5e385b33841d20c9f26196df,That's why I am refusing to spend any of my 26 gemstones on masterwork chests. Don't want to take that risk.

3974,5e385b33841d20c9f26196eb,"Would be neat if there was a special chest ""Gemstone chest"", guaranteed skin and has a slightly higher chance for a mythical skin."
3975,5e385b33841d20c9f26196ef,"I like emotes, so speak for yourself.

That said, getting one you already own is bs."
3976,5e385b33841d20c9f26196f3,those really feel like a scam
3977,5e385b33841d20c9f26196f7,Especially considering I can only have 5 equipped at the same bloody time. I have like 50 now from various rewards and chests and stuff and can only use 10% of them!
3978,5e385b33841d20c9f26196fb,At least make it an emote I don’t already own!
3979,5e385b33841d20c9f26196ff,"Yeah, YEAH!!!! Someone finally called it. Masterwork feels even worse than regular chests since you spend something to get them but they STILL contain utter garbage emotes or ward skins. You almost never should waste a gemstone on a masterwork chest unless you need ~200 OE for a skin you'd like to  unlock in your Hextech inventory. Let those lay around. You'll eventually hit 10 gemstones since how easy it became to get them through event passes, essence emporium, event capsules etc."
3980,5e385b33841d20c9f2619703,"I like emotes actually, because most skins are for champions I'll never be interested in, but I can take up to 5 emotes to use on any champion.

The only issue I have with emotes is that tons of them don't express an emotion or match a situation quite right.  They're like...slightly uncanny, or strange.  Like the poro ones in general.  The art is cute, but when would I use this, like, ever?

There are some very good ones though.  Laugh crying Riven, UwU Nami."
3981,5e385b33841d20c9f2619707,"I get what you’re saying.

But masterwork chests are different from normal hextech chests. They also cost a rare currency and by that premise I think they shouldn’t contain emotes. 

Gemstones aren’t easy to come by."
3982,5e385b34841d20c9f261970b,how the fuck is that riot's fault tho. Why would you buy a chest with 50k RP lmao that's your own fault and nothing else.
3983,5e385b34841d20c9f261970f,I understand. And normal chests I couldn’t care less. But for a gemstone? That seems a bit rough.
3984,5e385b34841d20c9f2619713,So true.
3985,5e385b34841d20c9f2619717,I had 11 so I figured why not.
3986,5e385b34841d20c9f261971b,"However much you like them, how are emotes and prestige skins non content?"
3987,5e385b34841d20c9f261971f,"I use emotes every game, so... no"
3988,5e385b34841d20c9f2619723,I love emotes
3989,5e385b34841d20c9f2619727,Those who don't care about the 10 gem skins.
3990,5e385b34841d20c9f261972b,I wanted to see what I would get
3991,5e385b34841d20c9f261972f,I agree. This should be a thing. But riot would make it cost 5 gemstones
3992,5e385b34841d20c9f2619733,"Why lol, you can reroll emotes that you already own."
3993,5e385b34841d20c9f2619737,"Gambling is a scam. It's literally designed for you to lose out and get addicted. If you play expecting to get what you want, you'll always be disappointed."
3994,5e385b34841d20c9f261973b,"This is the thing that irritates me the most, stop giving me emotes when I can only have fucking 5!! I like the ones i have right now so I cannot switch any of them out, yea I like some others and would use them if i could actually have another emote wheel or something"
3995,5e385b34841d20c9f261973f,cries in over 100 emotes
3996,5e385b34841d20c9f2619743,U can reroll the emote so that you get a random emote instead
3997,5e385b34841d20c9f2619747,the yuumi ones are good when you're yuumi. i just use the hi one when i do something egregious to the enemy team.
3998,5e385b34841d20c9f261974b,"I have so many but I only mostly only use the UwU Nami one, but when Gragas gets an emote imma instabuy that bad boy"
3999,5e385b35841d20c9f261974f,"I get what you're saying.

But to reiterate, you get the same chest regardless of where you get it from.

If you are concerned with your value, you should not spend the rare currency.  Masterwork chests are available in the store for RP, as a normal purchasable good. 

I'm sorry you feel your gem wasn't worth it, but this isn't an issue beyond your feeling bad about it.  I used my refund tokens on a skin I ended up buying in the future.  Lessons learned for both of us."
4000,5e385b35841d20c9f2619753,"how about just not spending the most valuable currency in League on a fucking chest lol.

it's like buying a 50ct scratch lottery ticket with a 100$ bill because you don't have a smaller one."
4001,5e385b35841d20c9f2619757,">They also cost a rare currency and by that premise I think they shouldn’t contain emotes.

Correct, and the real issue here is that you shouldn't be spending gemstones on masterwork chests because they're not worth it. Tbh it shouldn't even be an option, it's a noobtrap. I guess just in case someone doesn't want any of the gemstone content.

You can also just buy masterworks with RP, they're not even that much more expensive than regular chests. You should've seen that and realized that it's probably not worth it compared to the limited edition content that gemstones were intended for."
4002,5e385b35841d20c9f261975b,"But they also only cost what, 75 more RP than a regular chest? I get it, you used a Gemstone for it...but you knew what could happen."
4003,5e385b35841d20c9f261975f,"Masterwork chests contain emotes.

If you're spending a gemstone on a masterwork chest, you're getting a chest that contains emotes.

If you do not want a chest that contains emotes, do not spend your gemstone on a chest that contains emotes.

In the end, hextech is a gambling-type system. Emotes and cheap champions exist because they can't only give you good stuff, that's not a good business practice. Your post is akin to complaining that you spent $30 at the lottery and won nothing."
4004,5e385b35841d20c9f2619763,"1 - BE not rp
2 - 600 OE and nothing else in a MW chest is bullshit"
4005,5e385b35841d20c9f2619767,"You keep saying this as if that’s the only way to receive that chest. I don’t know why you keep saying that. 

That’s the whole point of loot boxes. It’s gambling."
4006,5e385b35841d20c9f261976b,"Yeah, it is. It's not an even trade which is very tempting to take since masterwork chests sometimes give great stuff."
4007,5e385b35841d20c9f261976f,"How you got the chest from is irrelevant. What if you got the gemstone from a regular chest? So the order went Chest->Gemstone->Masterwok->Emote.

By your logic there is nothing to complain about because it's essentially a free chest gave you an emote. You know what you can get when you open a MW chest. If you may not like it, don't get one."

4023,5e385b37841d20c9f26197b0,"Nice roundup and I appreciate how early after a game day it is because it also makes it easy to remember what plays he's talking about other than when you try to talk about specific plays that happened at a saturday game talked about on a Thursday.

Not sure about Jatts take on LEC. I think G2 is only miles ahead of the bottom 6 teams while the top 4 currently all play pretty decent league of legends."
4024,5e385b37841d20c9f26197b4,"Theres a pretty clear top 4 in Lec that you can be sold on imo at least for spring, rogue looked a bit shakier this week against OG but we'll see. G2 are just better but that's expected no new people coming in, a role-swap sure but otherwise its the same team that went to world finals"
4025,5e385b37841d20c9f26197b8,Yes thank you for this! I was thinking this last week that someone needed to talk about the games immediately after they happen. Loving the new podcast!
4026,5e385b37841d20c9f26197bc,I actually agree with him on the SK vs FNC game. Watching that game felt so bad because I just kept seeing Trick do no damage in fights and SK not abusing their 3 global ults
4027,5e385b37841d20c9f26197c0,The new podcasts from Jatt and Frosk have been great so far.
4028,5e385b37841d20c9f26197c4,"Thanks for listening! Depending on reception, might go a little bit more detailed into LEC next time. To clarify, I don’t think it’s G2 and then 9 others, just that G2 is clearly better than the other top 4. Agree that there’s a fairly clear top 4 so far, just that G2 is clearly at the top of that top 4."
4029,5e385b37841d20c9f26197c8,"He makes it sound, like 9 out 10 LEC team are on the same level or below LCS, which is freaking insane."
4030,5e385b37841d20c9f26197cc,Almost like watching LCS.
4031,5e385b37841d20c9f26197d0,It was definitely a bad game in terms of quality but I mostly blame the poorly executed rengar pick (strategy wise) and the inability for so to play to their win condition.
4032,5e385b37841d20c9f26197d4,Frosk has a podcast?
4033,5e385b37841d20c9f26197d8,Frosks pod?
4034,5e385b37841d20c9f26197dc,Really looking forward to the next episodes! The way it is structured and delivered makes it filling a niche that the others podcast don't cater towards so much.
4035,5e385b37841d20c9f26197e0,The only LCS team that is looking like it could be in  EU top 4 right now is C9 and there is literally no way they can beat G2.
4036,5e385b37841d20c9f26197e4,"True. G2, Fnatic, Origen & Rogue are all good, while G2 is right now on another level, due to them sticking with the same roster. 
People seem to forget that most other teams have a lot of rookies & young players on them. Mad lions, Sk, Misfits & Vitality have a lot of rookies who simple need more experience just like Caps in 2017 or Perkz in 2016 did. 
The only team who is disappointing right now is Schalke 04 with the amount of experience players they have outside of Abbedagge."
4037,5e385b37841d20c9f26197e8,The Other Analyst Desk: https://open.spotify.com/show/1SZ8kPbhRCHJg5qBfrrlUL
4038,5e385b38841d20c9f26197ec,"The other analyst desk aka TOAD with Veteran and Crumbz, pretty good imo"
4039,5e385b38841d20c9f26197f0,In a best of 5 I'd out my money on rogue tbh. The only role where c9 is not ouclassed is adc. But I think it's close cause c9 has some amazing synergy going on so who knows.
4040,5e385b38841d20c9f26197f4,So it's those 3 as the hosts?
4041,5e385b38841d20c9f26197f8,"Somewhat ye, Frosk is basicly the host for every episode while Veteran and Crumbz appear occasionally. All 3 talk about various stuff in episode 1+2, ep3 is only LCS so its Crumbz talking with Frosk and ep4 is Veteran with Frosk. Newest ep ""LCS week1"" is also just Frosk and Crumbz."
4042,5e385b3a841d20c9f26197fd,"Bro no. I'm also a taric main and that's not why it works.

To remove funnel strats in general, they need to change how junglers get income. They need to make it so there is a limit for how much you can get from lanes, like spelltheif.

The reason taric is best for all this, is inherent synergy with yi, and the value of his ult late game despite having no items.

Most supports have value without gold, but it's too easy for Yi to get ahead by funneling and taric Yi synergy is one if the best in the game.

Not JUST for his ult either, but also the being able to stun off Yi while he is in alpha. Which is really good for getting your kills pre 6

If it was the taric that was the problem, he could just go support and get the same affects."
4043,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619801,I'd rather see Yi gutted.
4044,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619805,"It's such an inelegant and tacked-on solution, though... 

And I honestly doubt it would solve it, the extra armor is the least of Taric's problems as a good funneler. If we put some maths into it, after he gets Knight's Vow + Zeke's, Taric will have about 200/250 armor (without Bastion). That translates into 40\~50 extra amor for his blessed ally. Cutting 20\~25 armor from them won't solve the issue, it's not like *that* is the gamebreaking part of Taric+Yi/Kassadin funnel."
4045,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619809,"That would change support Taric too, and heavily so. You don't exclusively lane with ranged champions, and in midgame onwards you'll W on melee champions usually to follow their engages."
4046,5e385b3b841d20c9f261980d,They need to make it so rage blade isnt like a 2 item powerspike on yi.
4047,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619811," I love how everyone is straight up like ""Nerf jungle, it is so OP, make it so they can't get any gold or exp from minions!"", dude, it's just a single strat that's strong, the entire fucking jungle is shitty, without lane exp, junglers are outleveled even by duo laners, their win rate falls off hard post 15 mins and people are still asking for nerfs. Looking at the map and warding is hard, ggez"
4048,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619815,nerf yi already dumb champ rework list
4049,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619819,You're clueless. No offense. This wouldn't stop funnel at all.. just stick with your taric support or whatever you do.
4050,5e385b3b841d20c9f261981d,"Gut funnel please. I cannot even describe how disgusting it is to play against it.

Quite literally the least fun one can have in this game, I think."
4051,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619821,Just read 10.3 patch notes..
4052,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619825,"Worst ""solution"" from a main i've ever seen, and that's saying something."
4053,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619829,"Yi is overpowered and theres this myth hes super easy to shutdown. I get shit on him all the fucking time in Diamond he doesnt go away with higher elo. 

Please just gut Yi I'm so sick of dodging when I see him. It isnt taric it isnt his items it isnt conqueror or the meta or whatever fucking excuse this community has to give whenever something is overpowered. Its the champion its Yi"
4054,5e385b3b841d20c9f261982d,Add a lane minion exp debuff to the jungle item
4055,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619831,Bro funneling will be dead after [patch 10.3] (https://images.gamewatcherstatic.com/image/file/7/23/105487/large_League-of-Legends-10-3-Jungle-Experience.jpg)
4056,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619835,"Its not taric. Its yi. You cant reliably funnel any champ other than Yi. Twitch comes close but his problem is that he still can be disengaged from whereas master yi simply dives head first into you with 0 counterplay unless u have a fiddlesticks but he ll qss then prolly.

&#x200B;

Maybe Yi shouldnt be able to like insta stack Rageblade with 1 Q because it works with his passive."
4057,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619839,I wish that guy who picked Taric mid in my game would know what funneling strat is. We had Graves jungle...it ended horribly.
4058,5e385b3b841d20c9f261983d,I would propose to gut they xp / gold when 2 people with smite are close to each other so they any funnel comp can't roam as 2 to the waves and jungle this also doesn't kill niche strats like a laner with smite
4059,5e385b3b841d20c9f2619841,"I like the idea that If you have a Targons, you can't give gold to the jungler. It's only a minor inconvenience for support and would hard nerf taric's income with the strat. Now obviously people could still prob run this combo, but it wouldnt be as effective."
4060,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619845,I think the already said they are nerfing Funnel gold.
4061,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619849,How would it be if support items were not allowed on solo lanes?
4062,5e385b3c841d20c9f261984d,"taric as a funnel champion is in no way played because of the passive armour, you could completely cut the passive armour given and he'd still be played - you're completely missing the point of why he is played.  
  
the funnelling exists because of how beneficial taric is *without items*, and how strong yi is *with* items, and how much gold you can accrue on yi whilst funnelling. It's a topic of gold generation on junglers, not taric's numbers in any way. He's literally just an ult and stun bot for yi."
4063,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619851,"Except that nerf would probably do next to nothing. It certainly wouldn't be a 11% swing.

Taric is in this weird case where he honestly kinda sucks at everything but these abuse cases. Fixing the abuse cases in all liklihood makes him even worse at literally everything else which he's already pretty weak at."
4064,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619855,No need to worry they already put 3 more gold penalty for funneling and it goes away only at minute 14 not when you close jungle item
4065,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619859,I was JUST looking at his winrate. It's an average of 56% across all lanes combined. it's insane.
4066,5e385b3c841d20c9f261985d,"The issue is Rageblade

Yi without Rageblade is ok (perhams even on the weak side).

Yi with Rageblade is NOT ok"
4067,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619861,My solution to this should be simple: HARD nerf gold and xp someone with smite takes from lane minions in the first 10-15 minutes. This will permanently kill the funneling as well as the smite taking smite strats. And won't even affect good junglers or champions anyway since a jungler should not be farming waves at that point.
4068,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619865,"Literally just make it so that if any target that Taric is connected to via Bastion goes untargetable, remove Bastion. Additionally, if Bastion is removed while a spell is channeling on the Bastion'd target, make it only cast on Taric.


Kills Yi Taric on the spot because if he Alpha strikes, no E from Taric, no ultimate, no heals, no armor. Yi wants to alpha strike often, and if he does that, he loses all of Taric's benefits."
4069,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619869,"I’m a plat player.... so mid elo.   

Problem is yi and his alpha strike.  The Q needs to be reworked.  Alpha strike is bullshit.  If they just change the one skill, he will be ok."
4070,5e385b3c841d20c9f261986d,"I get some of your point and really I'd rather have rito hard nerf Yi and Kassadin but I haven't seen any nerfs coming for either.  Yi causes so many problems in low elo and is never seen in high elo or pro outside of funneling that the change would be a good one overall.

&#x200B;

Kassadin is a harder call since I don't think he's inherently broken or bad for the game unless being funneled.

&#x200B;

Possibly the best solution would be to make excess minion kills before 20 mins worth 0 Gold but either way something DOES need to be done to stop funneling it's no fun for anyone except the 2 funnelers and when 2 people ruin the game for 8 other players it's not OK."
4071,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619871,"Nah, the problem is that Taric's kit sucks in modern League. It was pretty decent at the time of the rework but since then they've had wayyyy too much dash/mobility creep and it's put Taric in a place where the two things he's good for now are protecting a squishy-hyper carry and his ult. The ""skillshot e"" and autoattacking parts of his kit just suck now. The ult took a brutal nerf already because it was ""too high impact"" relative to its cooldown. His itemization sucks in regular lane situations and it doesn't seem like Riot really cares about him in any meaningful way. Honestly the whole kit just needs a soft re-work at this point..."
4072,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619875,Please don't nerf him.. I have a 81% winrate d3 account with funnel lmao
4073,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619879,"That's already in the game, if someone with a uncomplete jungle item farms more lane minions than jungle minions he will receive less gold from lane minions"
4074,5e385b3c841d20c9f261987d,"Yeah it’s not Taric that’s a problem, it’s Yi. They need to make it so that as a jungle you just get no gold from minion kills when there’s an enemy without the monster hunter passive (JG item) within so many units. 


Basically it would make it so that you get low amounts of gold from lane minions as long as the enemy jungler isn’t in the lane as well. It would still allow split push JG play styles to exist and let jungles push waves after a gank. It would make it so that a carry JG can’t walk into a lane for farm and leave. 


Funneling is a bullshit strat though and they need to fix this shit."
4075,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619881,"They need to rework him already, he has almost the same exact kit he had when he was released, and its super toxic. 

I hope they dont leave him in his ridiculous feast or famine state just because they want new players to have some fun abusing him or some shit..."
4076,5e385b3c841d20c9f2619885,Nah they will gut everyone else again.
4077,5e385b3d841d20c9f2619889,"People busy complaining about the emo boy with a neon color pallete while this fucking champion has plagued my life for 10 god damn years.


I fucking despise when Yi is a strong pick. He never gets competitive play so he flys under the radar when it comes to balancing for so fucking long."
4078,5e385b3d841d20c9f261988d,Everyone else i think too
4079,5e385b3d841d20c9f2619891,"Honestly the same thing works with a bunch of champions, Yi is just the best. All you need is an ability to clear waves super fast, and if you have Kaisa she can do that with her rockets, Tryn could do it with his whirl, people will just go for the next best funnel champ."
4080,5e385b3d841d20c9f2619895,"Yes. I literally never see this talked about but, and especially with the new conqueror healing, Yi is absolutely busted. Even in diamond+ (I was diamond3 last season, plat2 right now) he has like a 51.50% winrate. The healinghe gets from conqueror as well as having bloodrazor and guinsoos makes him fucking unstoppable unless you have enough cc to burst him down (hope he doesn’t dodge it with his q, or you use cc to catch out another person and suddenly yi comes in so have to perma save your abilities) But the problem is there are so many games where we have a team with very little cc. 

Ya if you shut yi down early it can be fine but if he comes out even he has the chance to take the game. If he comes out ahead it’s probably over (unless you have the aforementioned cc, but again more often than not I have teams with little cc) 

The champ is just disgusting. Just tired of the games where Yi can literally 1v5 and we can do nothing because we don’t have adequate cc."
4081,5e385b3d841d20c9f2619899,"What irritates me about Yi is that players shouldn't have to change what they were going / wanted to play just because of one champ. That said, I'm garbage low elo so it might just be me."
4082,5e385b3d841d20c9f261989d,"One of the worst parts about him is that AS slows doesn't work on him due to his ult so there's no way to itemize against him for tanks since he'll just melt you with his mixed damage.

It's insane that a 1k armor malphite can't do anything against him beyond his ult."
4083,5e385b3d841d20c9f26198a1,"taric is not picked to funnel in ANY way for his passive armour bonus, this guy's just shown a complete misunderstanding of why he's actually played. One of the guy i boost with uses this sometimes in high dia/masters and he didn't even know about the armour bonus.  
  
He's played because he's incredibly safe sitting back and holding waves in lane, and because his R and stun have *no* weighting on items which means he suffers in no way from minimal gold generation, he's just an R and stun bot for yi.  
  
tbh it's not even that bad, I really have no problem with taric/yi. It's not nearly as strong as two strong duos on well known champions to them. There's a reason if you were to get a boost you'd probably never be asked by your booster to allow yi/taric."
4084,5e385b3d841d20c9f26198a5,"Yeah, if Taric gets nerfed funnelers will just play Lulu, Karma or literally any support.

Fuck rageblade, fuck Yi's true damage, and fuck rageblade interaction with his passive."
4085,5e385b3d841d20c9f26198a9,I think you just play jungle wrong if you're the lowest level in the game
4086,5e385b3d841d20c9f26198ad,That is not how the nerf works though. You would have to be in a lane a lot to see it on a regular jungler. If you get a few creeps when you help push a lane into the tower it doesn't matter. Also most other junglers like the XP from helping with a push more than the actual gold.
4087,5e385b3d841d20c9f26198b1,"I second this, this would also make repeat ""failed"" jungle ganks punished harder and xp could be buffed for jungle. Complete win/win"
4088,5e385b3d841d20c9f26198b5,"> Maybe Yi shouldnt be able to like insta stack Rageblade with 1 Q because it works with his passive.

Except it doesnt work like that at all?"
4089,5e385b3d841d20c9f26198b9,Funnel karthus is actually disgusting and it works with many different supports. Soraka is really good with him because you have so much global presence.
4090,5e385b3d841d20c9f26198bd,That doesn't solve funneling though. Most tarics I've seen that funnel run heal/exhaust not smite with the yi.
4091,5e385b3d841d20c9f26198c1,So if the jungle gets a successful gank and then helps push the wave to take a tower plate he should get gimped on XP?
4092,5e385b3d841d20c9f26198c5,Good Junglers hold/shove waves for their laners though.
4093,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198c9,I also came to this conclusion. Hard agree. Make it like spellthiefs where you can't take wave cs
4094,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198cd,Cool with this if they restore jg xp rates.
4095,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198d1,That is actually reasonable. In fact it feels actually like everything
4096,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198d5,Literally nobody asked
4097,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198d9,Aaaaaaaaaand you're one of the reasons why this **has** to be nerfed
4098,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198dd,"If the only reason your in that rank is because of some cheap funnel strat, then you don't deserve to being that rank"
4099,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198e1,"Yes, and riot doubles down on that.

From -10 to -14 and only removed at 14 mins bit when upgrading the jungle item. 

Solves the problem most likely."
4100,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198e5,Honestly just cut the gold from lane minions for the first minutes and be done with funneling. In which scenario is a jungler farming lane creeps anyway? After a successfull gank the jungler is dropping the minions low for the laner to take them and off he goes to clear his jungle.
4101,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198e9,Then make it so junglers can't receive targons gold
4102,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198ed,That makes no sense bro. Changes from 10.3 will be enough.
4103,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198f1,So your solution is to nerf the entirety of the jungle for a start involving one jungler? Lane EXP and gold can be huge if you gank and tax.
4104,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198f5,I doubt new players abuse him. It's more like smurfs abuse new players with him
4105,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198f9,trynd fits this category as well.
4106,5e385b3e841d20c9f26198fd,His Q used to scale hard off AP and would reset on kills not auto attacks. He could Q five times in a row for a penta. It was more busted than current Yi. Never forget.
4107,5e385b3e841d20c9f2619901,him and tryndamere should just be nuked.  they are bad for high elo and wrecks low elo with no effort.   just rework them both already tbh.
4108,5e385b3f841d20c9f2619905,why is his kit toxic?
4109,5e385b3f841d20c9f2619909,True.
4110,5e385b3f841d20c9f261990d,Probably
4111,5e385b3f841d20c9f2619911,"Same, people like to pretend they've surpassed Master Yi and is a low elo stuff. 

Bro I'm in fucking diamond, I've played this game for 6y and I always ban this champion, if you don't bring a champion with heavy targeted cc, you are fucked

His early is not as bad as people think he's, since the q now hits 3 times he can outduel most champions in the early, has a fucking ability which heals him and gives him damage reduction, high as and true damage.

And he snowballs harderd than a fucking Katarina, once he kills your botlane once (by flashing over the wall and ulting right at them) the game is over for you. He just runs down all the players without cc, outfarms your jungler and speedruns objectives.

Oh, and funnel. Fuck that champion 100% br for me, I much rather prefer play vs k6 onetricks than Yi onetricks"
4112,5e385b3f841d20c9f2619915,It's not just you.
4113,5e385b3f841d20c9f2619919,Yeah Yis the only funnel champs that feels op to play vs no other champs can reset tower aggro and has that true dmg lol
4114,5e385b3f841d20c9f261991d,I think that taric's synergy with yi is too good that other supports dont work
4115,5e385b3f841d20c9f2619921,"And before anyone says ""but look at pro play!""

Pro games are entirely different to solo queue and shouldn't be the sole consideration on how strong/weak jungle xp is."
4116,5e385b3f841d20c9f2619925,"This thread is a dumpster fire of misinformation, misguided changes and what not. This is why people aren't taken seriously when they talk about balance here."
4117,5e385b3f841d20c9f2619929,"Yes but karthus cant solo win a teamfight by himself. Plus he cant dive a lane come lvl 6 because he is skill shot reliant, he is slow etc."
4118,5e385b3f841d20c9f261992d,Oh did it change ? I remember that the first iteration of funnel runned smite in taric too . I guess that the Nerf coming in the next patch will be enough then although I think yo should get the kass / Kyle treatment be a minion until 16 then you can run my team over if we didn't do shit in the game
4119,5e385b3f841d20c9f2619931,"Yes. Good junglers don't even take the cs when they ""help"" pushing. They let the cs low enough so that the laners will last hit them."
4120,5e385b3f841d20c9f2619935,As a jungler its good idea to just damage minions without lasthitting and move away so laners could get full exp and gold anyways
4121,5e385b3f841d20c9f2619939,"Only when their laner tells them to, because a good laner will be maintaining their wave control and not want the jungler deciding to screw with it."

4125,5e385b40841d20c9f2619949,idc its free easy wins ima keep abusing it lolz
4126,5e385b40841d20c9f261994d,"Kinda feels like a nerf to support honestly. Trying to push a wave after a good gank but the ADC dies, you can't get your Targon procs which delays your getting wards"
4127,5e385b40841d20c9f2619951,"If you'd read you would see it's only less xp when there is a enemy laner, not jg, in a lane vs them. 


You can still split and still help a laner push after ganks.

Also let's be real, if you fail your gank and sit behind to eat 3 minions from your laner then you're not helping yourself or your laner."
4128,5e385b40841d20c9f2619955,[IIRC this caused them to take away the ap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8DdBx078Tc) and all ARAM players rejoiced.
4129,5e385b40841d20c9f2619959,"He's a stat check champion with too few mechanics. There's very little room either for him to outplay his opponents or for his opponents to outplay him. 

He runs at enemies and is either locked down with CC and dies instantly, or he out-stats the entire enemy team and auto-attacks them to death in a few seconds."
4130,5e385b40841d20c9f261995d,"If Yi is sufficiently farmed he gets to a point where he runs at anyone and that person dies.

And if your team doesn't have enough CC, then he runs at your team and your team dies.

Yi is asking your team two questions: Do you guys have hard CC to deal with a melee assassin & is your jungler capable of bullying him enough? If either is a no, he will probably run you over."
4131,5e385b40841d20c9f2619961,Because the average elo in this subreddit is silver/gold.

4133,5e385b40841d20c9f2619969,"Lulu would work. 

Pixie on yi will slow on lulu Q which would replace the stun from taric and her ult for more HP + her shielding would make up for invuln from tartic ult."
4134,5e385b40841d20c9f261996d,"Good junglers in which ELO? Cause as far as I've seen on proplay and high elo streams, they just push it as fast as possible cause it's not about giving someone income, is about to maximize the gold/exp lost on the enemy team.

With that said, if I'm playing, let's say Ornn top and Yi jungle, why should Ornn take the farm if Yi scales way better with gold?"
4135,5e385b40841d20c9f2619971,And when the laner is dead?
4136,5e385b40841d20c9f2619975,What does taking or not taking cs have anything to do with getting xp?
4137,5e385b40841d20c9f2619979,"Yeah sure, if you want to be 5 levels behind instead of 3."
4138,5e385b40841d20c9f261997d,"Many situations require jungle attention to the wave management whether or not the laner has played correctly. 

Sometimes you need help to crash because the opponent is playing TP and you are not. Some matchups involve champions with no ressources against champions with ressources so you need help to crash as well. Sometimes an all-in has put you low hp and you need help to crash."
4139,5e385b40841d20c9f2619981,Yeah there’s no way support can afford a nerf like that the role is really weak
4140,5e385b40841d20c9f2619985,What if your laner backed and you go to hold the lane? You get punished for helping? And even what you just said still doesn’t apply. I did read it. It shouldn’t matter whether it’s a laner or a jungler versus them.
4141,5e385b40841d20c9f2619989,God damn watching a clip from earlier seasons is so weird. Look how much damage everyone can tank. It feels surreal. Nowadays everyone dies to everything instantly.
4142,5e385b41841d20c9f261998d,especially considering how much they argued OG aatrox for being a statcheck champ..  ironically they left 2 champs that are even more.. trynda and yi lol
4143,5e385b41841d20c9f2619991,Counter point: the entire ADC role
4144,5e385b41841d20c9f2619995,"dodging abilties with his alpha is ""very little room for outplay""??

what are you even talking"
4145,5e385b41841d20c9f2619999,This is the real answer. Master Yi above gold is nearly non existent and everyone knows you cc him like once he gets blown up if he can’t w in time.
4146,5e385b41841d20c9f261999d,"Talk about niche scenarios: a successful gank that leads with your team mate dying and a full wave that needs your clearing in order to help your laner? Well even so , if the jungle xp/gold would be balanced and junglers take 0 from lane cs, this should not affect the overall performance of a good jungler."
4147,5e385b41841d20c9f26199a1,"Yeah you need the XP, Gold not so much, but XP is required. If you gank and just push the enemy back you essentially didn't gain anything as a jungler so helping your laner push into the tower removes that issue."
4148,5e385b41841d20c9f26199a5,"My favorite mid tactic is to stay in lane with low hp after successful gank then, ping your jungler that is trying to protect you from enemy jungler to go away and then give away free solo kill to enemy jungler."
4149,5e385b41841d20c9f26199a9,the jg item gives a passive called monster hunter. You need that passive nearby in order to get creep xp. There's already a soft version of this in the game lol. If you get the jg item and have smite you get less gold per minion kill.
4150,5e385b41841d20c9f26199ad,Literally the first second an ashe almost dies from 2 Draven auto attacks at lvl 1 LMAO
4151,5e385b41841d20c9f26199b1,There is almost always counterplay to adc’s. There is very very little counterplay to a fed yi.. especially a funnelled one.
4152,5e385b41841d20c9f26199b5,"Unfortunately its just not enough, especially since its not like he relies on it completely to win fights, and even if they changed him to do so that would make him unuseable, since a lot of important abilities could only be dodged through ""anticipation"" (guessing)."
4153,5e385b41841d20c9f26199b9,"There is so little mechanical skill in Yi it's just auto auto, q when they want to trade back auto E auto W if you need the attack reset or heal and q again"
4154,5e385b41841d20c9f26199bd,"Ah yes, pressing q
Such outplay wow"
4155,5e385b41841d20c9f26199c1,Funnel yi is very much a thing in high Elo.
4156,5e385b41841d20c9f26199c5,"Ah ya that’s why in platinum+ master Yi is the 5th highest jungler in winrate and in diamond+ (with the same winrate in platinum+) he is in 8th. Because he’s bad right?

That’s why in my high plat / low diamond games Master Yi is starting to be banned. 

Add that with the fact that it’s pretty common to have teams with minimal cc / cc he will easily dodge with q. 

Master Yi is so nonexistent above gold that in platinum+ he’s the 6th most picked jungler? Diamond is a bit lower to be fair only the 10th most picked!"
4157,5e385b41841d20c9f26199c9,u know there are a lot of funnelers abusing ir in high elo dont you or
4158,5e385b41841d20c9f26199cd,Who said it had to be a gank? Laner dies and enemy laner shoves into tower leaving free farm under your tower. I don't think that's niche at all
4159,5e385b42841d20c9f26199d1,"I just want to say what a wonderful idea this is. Jungle, already struggling and being the worst role after their previous xp nerfs, definitely should have their xp nerfed again. This time however you nerf the lane xp so that instead of being encouraged to gank more, they’re encouraged to play a bootleg version of WoW in which you attack camps for ~7 minutes snd then go fight a raid boss in the form of a dragon. I also propose we only allow champions with a skin from the “dragon slayer” skin line to only jungle now too, seeing as that is your sole reason for existence once your xp changes are implemented. It’ll workout great since Olaf just got his dragon slayer skin so he’s all you’ll fucking see anyway."
4160,5e385b42841d20c9f26199d5,"Don't forget typing ""jg diff"""
4161,5e385b42841d20c9f26199d9,"False, literally tons of counter play. Anyone with CC is a counter. Burst CC even more so. This is why taric is so powerful with him. And yet they still dont play yi in competitive because hes actually a dumpster champ. We are bad, so champs with no mechanics smash us while we try to play the harder ones."
4162,5e385b42841d20c9f26199dd,"ADCs and Master Yi have the exact same counterplay though: CC them to stop them from autoing, or jump them hard and burst them down. The only significant difference between Yi and what an ADC fundamentally is is trading range for movement speed.  
  
My only major point of salt is that ADCs and Master Yi can exist, but old Aatrox can't :("

If you only got it by a hair, the animation makes it look like the entire hook gets extended range despite it only being a visual thing, so it just feels far more BS, since you have such a hard time eye balling when it can actually hit unless you have experience with it.

The hook being too large is one problem, but the lack of visual information is what makes it feel like BS, it's the same with Thresh and Blitz hooks, their animation just don't have the same ""feedback"" when you hit for a lack of a better word."

Once you reach that point where you're in the exact elo you belong in, things tend to turn to shit because every game becomes a 50/50. And half the time you feel completely useless because as much as you try, you're just not good enough to make a difference. 

This is where a mentality shift is needed. All focus needs to be turned towards improving because it's the only way you're going to be able to consistently move forward and gain control over the games again.

4238,5e385b49841d20c9f2619b10,"No, the worst feeling in League is when you do the right thing, but at least 2 other players are monkeying around, actively dragging the enemy team back into the lead. That irritates me the most, doing things right but your team isn't on the same level as you."
4239,5e385b49841d20c9f2619b14,Ah a fellow Zed player when the enemy spends 300g
4240,5e385b49841d20c9f2619b18,"The worst imo, is playing a champ that just get utterly ignored no matter what you're doing while the enemies are murdering your team.

Like a bruiser with no/low cc and low damage by example."
4241,5e385b49841d20c9f2619b1c,"Ah, when you ask your team to pick a tank and they lock shaco and tryndamere as your last two picks"
4242,5e385b49841d20c9f2619b20,"Nah that's fine, it means you didn't play to your champs niche or the other team countered it. As long as the champs in your game are binary it's always fun"
4243,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b24,"You could have saved time and said ""playing jungle in season 10"" literally if you arent steam rolling the ennemy and one shotting them left and right, you are at best down 2 levels and just have to follow what your laners want to do hoping  you don't fall further behind since you already admit to yourself that you'll not be having fun"
4244,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b28,IMO it feels way worse when you’re smurfing on the game but you still end up losing because your team mates are dead weight.
4245,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b2c,"No, the worst feeling is losing a game because your teammates fed and you aren't good/fed enough to carry them."
4246,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b30,"this is what laning against garen feels like. Always fun when you cannot deal damage, but get killed by one combo. Also he outsustains you with ease. really great champ design."
4247,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b34,"Also Ashe player, arguably the marksman with the most utility"
4248,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b38,"Two types of adc players:

People who think they don't do anything and feed every lane

People who realize they are the most broken role and carry every game"
4249,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b3c,"This is what I thought too, but the Zhonyas mention is throwing me off."
4250,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b40,ELO Purgatory sounds more fitting but I guess it doesn't roll off the tongue as well
4251,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b44,who made this crap up? elo hell is the phase of the climb where youre consistently 2x better/smarter than your teammates but the climb is drawn out because matchmaking wants you to carry them against a whole team of people in the next tier up
4252,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b48,"This had nothing to do with elo hell. A diamond player, hell, a pro player can experience what I'm talking about."
4253,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b4c,"Had a G4 0lp player in my game towards the end of last season. he had 1500 ranked games played in season 9. he was raging every 2 minutes in the game. Had to tell him ""buddy you're at g4 0lp with 1500 games played, you're exactly where you're supposed to be, winning or losing this game isn't going to do you any good."" Guy had like a 47% winrate as well.."
4254,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b50,People like to shit on top laners for low impact but honestly it's arguable that ADC has even less impact especially when it's a carry top laner.
4255,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b54,It's easier to accept that other people are trash than accepting that you yourself are trash tho
4256,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b58,"Bro this is true for every single lane too.  
  
 Get behind top? You are fucked, zoned off xp and farm, free when the jungle comes.   

Get behind mid? You are zoned off gold or your enemy can freely roam over and over, to double kill your bot.
  
 Get behind bot? You are zoned of gold, susceptible for dives over and over by that enemy mid roaming."
4257,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b5c,Jungle: Where you are constantly fighting 1v3 at your own wolves while somehow all your lanes are losing and the enemy is getting rift and drake at the same time.
4258,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b60,"i think in my last game as fiddle (last meaning i basically retired from playing him) i told the team ""hey guys i am just going to help by clearing out the enemy team jungle while you beat them. im useless in the group""."
4259,5e385b4a841d20c9f2619b64,all the shit in league and you choose to complain about Garen
4260,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b68,"Just play gnar..kite him, when you build frozen mallet Garen is free."
4261,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b6c,Teemo fucks garen in the ass
4262,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b70,Ashe is actually super good at solo carrying because of her ult and safe lane phase
4263,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b74,"Adc is by far not the most broken role, it's 2020 not 2017.
Adcs are basically 2nd worse role in the meta, jungler being the worst."
4264,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b78,"> People who realize they are the most broken role and carry every game

we are talking about adc here mate :)"
4265,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b7c,Cool why don't you main adc to diamond then since it's the most op role?
4266,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b80,At this point we should start building them just to live the constant tower dives
4267,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b84,Burning away your sins to make it into paradise. Yeah definitely sounds like purgatory
4268,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b88,"if I'm not mistaken purgatory used to be called limbo

so.. elo limbo?"
4269,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b8c,"What they're talking about isnt just for low elongation, elo hell is wherever your personal skill caps out. So for instance a diamond player getting into diamond 2 for instance maybe that's thair skill cap and so a lot of games end up like what you were explaining. I think you were both talking about the same thing but in different ways ."
4270,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b90,*implying you cant get hard stuck in diamond*
4271,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b94,It most certainly does. I think you're just sad now you realized you've peaked.
4272,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b98,"
I dont see a reason why you would be upset if you are the one that missplays all the time. You can just try to play better. The worst feeling is that your team being so bad that no matter how much you 1v3 they still lose. Because your teamates are a thing you have no control over.

Thats why many high level players have come to terms that not every game in winnable"
4273,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619b9c,"I'd say at a soloqueue level mid and support have the most impact currently, followed by top and jungle, then adc"
4274,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619ba0,"I have no problem into accepting that i'm trash, when i missplay or do something wrong i realize it and think of what i should have done instead.

What i dont accept is to be flamed for things i havent done/werent my mistake.

Just in that game: top and bot inhibs down, 5 of their people in their base clearing super minion waves, i call the baron and our yasuo goes B instead of doing baron. His justification? ""Jungler smite on cd, we cant"" and for that, he and the jungler were watching us doing baron while they died watching.

I legit hard carried that game in a way that my mental energy just instantly went off and i had to take a break.

A game shouldnt do this to a person, those kind of players do need to get punished. Being allowed to troll/grief that hard without getting punished is just beyond belief."
4275,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619ba4,"True,  you're absolutely right.  But the impact is  FAR more extreme for Junglers than any other lane  because they're not earning at the same pace as the rest of the lanes.    
  
If you get ganked early or miss a couple of waves as a laner,  so what you can still make a recovery.  If that happens as a jungler you basically take them out of the game."
4276,5e385b4b841d20c9f2619ba8,There is no paradise in league. You just go from one elohell into another.
4277,5e385b4c841d20c9f2619bac,el limbo
4278,5e385b4c841d20c9f2619bb0,I actually like this definition of elo hell. It makes it less of an excuse for your mistakes and more of an acceptance of your inadequacy.
4279,5e385b4c841d20c9f2619bb4,"I don't think he's saying he misplays all the time, but the frustration from those few games where you can't do a thing.

I totally get it, I don't like my teammates doing bad, but I hate when I'm doing bad. It feels like being utter dead weight and knowing that if you lose, you were a primary factor for it, and if you win, you were dragged towards that win. Shit sucks"
4280,5e385b4c841d20c9f2619bb8,For me it's probably mid -> jg -> supp -> top -> ad
4281,5e385b4c841d20c9f2619bbc,"If you think about it, a diamond player will not experience this in silver or gold elo. While a platinum player could very well start this experience in high silver, low gold already.

Elohell is different for everybody, because everyone has a different skill cap."
4282,5e385b4c841d20c9f2619bc0,"Yup, at least if your teammates are the reason you lost (like they actually hard inted and no matter what you did you couldn’t 1v4), even though it sucks, you know if you keep up your play you will win when you get humans on your team. If you are the one hard inting though, it’s very discouraging because you are hoping to coinflip a better team"
4283,5e385b4c841d20c9f2619bc4,"Exactly, it's incredibly discouraging and happens to everyone at one point or another, regardless of level of play. Very disheartening to happen, and at least for me, leaves me feeling pretty guilty afterwards regardless of result."
4284,5e385b4c841d20c9f2619bc9,"Just don't die in practice tool, ezpz"
4285,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619bcd,"It hasn't been working since at least a few patches now. Not sure what caused it, but it's definitely not high on their ""stuff to fix"" priority..."
4286,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619bd1,"agreed, very annoying thing when trying to limit test how much you can get away with on for example sett and then you gotta press a button 5 times instead of 1 button press to respawn"
4287,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619bd5,"Yeah. I feel like the client and it's utilities have gotten significantly worse since the end of season 9. It had some choppiness and bugs before, but now it's just egregious."
4288,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619bd9,just use the summoner spell then
4289,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619bdd,I sent an email to them in Season 9 ...guess where it landed :))
4290,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619be1,"somewhat unrelated, but is resetting the game in practice tool not supposed to reset the time anymore? ive noticed this a while ago"
4291,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619be5,"Uhh sorry but riot has more important issues to fix! Like their client which is breaking into pieces after every patch they release.. oh wait they don't give a damn about that either. FUCK RIOT, someone should be held accountable for all the dumb shit that's been happening lately."
4292,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619be9,I'd prefer having the dummies than my soloq teammates.
4293,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619bed,Big brain time
4294,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619bf1,"I am not a Riot programmer but I can think of a reason.

Do you remember back in the day the revive summoner spell? Yea, that one that no one used and got removed.

Turns out that they were just summoning that spell to revive people regularly. When you died and the timer for your respawn started, it was a timer for the revive summoner spell to trigger.

They fixed that for some reason unknown to me. Maybe it was getting bugged, maybe exploited by hacks... I remember crazy hacks back in the day when they introduced the revamped mastery tree, but they didn't last long thankfully.

My guess is that the piece of code was still there. And they saw it while doing the practice tool and they just reutilised it. Later, it got deleted because supposedly it isn't in the game anymore, but it actually was, so what we got is a non functioning revive button in the practise tool."
4295,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619bf5,But this is completely unrelated to the client.
4296,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619bf9,Looks like it
4297,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619bfd,Wouldn't we all
4298,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619c01,They’d actually probably be pretty broken since they’re immortal so they could just stop a wave forever.
4299,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619c05,*Laughs in Ryze or Bard*
4300,5e385b4d841d20c9f2619c09,Nah! I killed a dummy before so theyre not immortal
